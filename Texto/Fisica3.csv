<p>The simulator will use time-step integration at 60 fps, and typical collision detection stuff. For the magnetism I intend to compute force and torque between each pair of balls on every frame.</p>

<p>I think it will be ok to approximate each little ball as a ""point dipole"". What is the formula for force and torque?</p>

<p>For the force I have this from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_between_magnets#Magnetic_dipole-dipole_interaction"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a></p>

<p>${\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} ,\mathbf {m} _{1},\mathbf {m} _{2})={\frac {3\mu _{0}}{4\pi r^{5}}}\left[(\mathbf {m} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {r} )\mathbf {m} _{2}+(\mathbf {m} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {r} )\mathbf {m} _{1}+(\mathbf {m} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {m} _{2})\mathbf {r} -{\frac {5(\mathbf {m} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {r} )(\mathbf {m} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {r} )}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {r} \right]}$</p>

<p>But I think it gives the wrong answer. No matter what the direction of $\mathbf{m} _{1}$ or $\mathbf{m} _{2}$, I think the force must be always parallel to <strong>r</strong> to conserve angular momentum. However, suppose $\mathbf{m} _{1}$ is parallel to <strong>r</strong> and $\mathbf{m} _{2}$ is perpendicular: </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kAIGJ.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kAIGJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>All terms except the first vanish, and <strong>F</strong> is in the direction $\mathbf{m} _{2}$, which is not possible? Common sense tells me F should be zero in this case! What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Also I need a formula for the torque. I know $ \mathbf{\tau=m\times B } $, and on the same wiki page I got</p>

<p>${\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {m} ,\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi r^{3}}}\left(3(\mathbf {m} \cdot {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}){\hat {\mathbf {r} }}-\mathbf {m} \right)}$</p>

<p><em>(I dropped the dirac term, because I don't need it)</em>.</p>

<p>I haven't tried it yet, but <em>I think</em> I can compute the the torque around the center of mass of $\mathbf{m} _{2}$ with $ \mathbf{\tau=m _{2}\times B(m _{1}, r) } $ where <strong>r</strong> is position of $\mathbf{m} _{2}$ relative to $\mathbf{m} _{1}$. Since all the balls have identical mass and magnetism, the torque on $\mathbf{m} _{1}$ is the same but with opposite sign.</p>

<p>Does that look reasonable?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> the above force formula seems to be rubbish, but the flux density(B) is reasonable. I'm wondering if I can just use  $ \mathbf{\tau=m\times B } $ for torque and  $ \mathbf{F=(m\cdot B)\hat {\mathbf {r} } } $ for force. It has a nice symmetry, and gives good results in the simulation.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong> Another curious contradiction. According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole%E2%80%93dipole_interaction"" rel=""nofollow"">this wiki page</a>, the potential energy of a magnetic field is given by:</p>

<p>${\displaystyle H=-{\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi |{\mathbf {r}}|^{3}}}\left(3({\mathbf {m}}_{1}\cdot {\hat {\mathbf {r}}})({\mathbf {m}}_{2}\cdot {\hat {\mathbf {r}}})-{\mathbf {m}}_{1}\cdot {\mathbf {m}}_{2}\right)}$</p>

<p>And this implies as long as <strong>m</strong><sub>2</sub> is perpendicular to <strong>m</strong><sub>1</sub> and  <strong>r</strong>, the potential energy is ZERO. Since force is the gradient of potential over space, then the force must be also zero in that case. What am I misunderstanding?</p>

"268600","Why isn't mass conservation counted among the laws of thermodynamics?","<p>Is this purely a historical artifact, a consequence of how the original formulators of the three laws were thinking and experimenting at the time? Or is there a compelling scientific/logical reason why we ought to not include mass conservation as a fourth (or zeroth, or... negative first) law?</p>

<p>Note that I'm talking specifically about non-relativistic thermodynamics. So any answer invoking mass-energy equivalence, in order to show how mass conservation follows from mass-energy conservation at low speeds, isn't really what I'm looking for.</p>

"268610","Meaning of $\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} W(\mathbf p, h)$ in PBF","<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> on Position Based Fluids and I couldn't understand the meaning of $\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} W(\mathbf{ p_i - p_j}, h)$ in the equation 7 (see below).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the gradient of the
  constraint function (1) with respect to a particle k is given by:
  $\;\;\;\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} C_i(\mathbf p_1, \mathbf p_2, \ldots, \mathbf p_n) = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \sum\limits_j \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} W(\mathbf p_i - \mathbf p_j, h )$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the left hand side of the equation – it is $\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} C_i = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial \mathbf{p}_{k_X}} &amp; \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial \mathbf{p}_{k_Y}} &amp; \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial \mathbf{p}_{k_Z}}\end{bmatrix}$. However I cannot grasp the right hand side – the function $W$ is defined (AFAIK) as $W\colon \mathbb R^{n+1} \to \mathbb R$, meaning that it takes an $n-$dimensional vector and a scalar as the inputs and produces a scalar.</p>

<p><strong>I don't understand what does the notation $\nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k}W$ mean – in particular, why is there the subscript $\mathbf{p}_k$</strong> – the function $W$ doesn't take $n$ vectors as input, like the $C_i$ function does, so it cannot be differentiated with respect to $\mathbf{p}_k$ (it can be only to its first – vector – parameter and its second – scalar – parameter).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot to mention that $C_i\colon \mathbb R^{3n} \to \mathbb R$.</p>

"268617","Do Conch shell horns produce infrasound?","<p>I was just reading an article about some guys at Stanford playing with ancient conch shell horns: <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/february/conch-acoustic-musicians-020711.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/february/conch-acoustic-musicians-020711.html</a></p>

<p>They mention feeling their chest rattling and being nauseated from the sound.  I was thinking about the acoustical modes as the shell cavity is close to a logarithmic spiral in shape (I'm not going to attempt an analytic solution). The shell should be able to produce sound wavelengths much longer than the dimensions of the shell itself.</p>

<p>Has anyone come across this type of horn design before? Maybe for some kind of compact subwoofer, or even for a em waveguide? I'd be curious to know if it is in fact producing infrasound.</p>

<p><strong>addendum:</strong>
It's worth noting that the cochlea in our ears is similarly shaped, making me think that perhaps it's a useful shape for funneling wavelengths larger than itself</p>

"268618","How would my life be different without quantum entanglement?","<p>What would happen if for some reason quantum entanglement were suddenly turned off? By ""turned off"", let's say that every entangled state is immediately replaced with a separable (but still classically correlated) state, e.g. a Bell state $(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)/\sqrt2$ might be replaced with $(|00\rangle\langle 00|+|11\rangle\langle 11|)/2$. The laws of quantum mechanics still hold. </p>

<p>What effect would this have on my everyday life? Could I still get out of bed, have a shower, take the bus to work, etc.? I'm not interested in the effect it would have on physics experiments such as Bell nonlocality no longer being detectable. I am interested in my everyday life as a non-physicist.</p>

<p>I have seen <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-happened-if-quantum-entanglement-ceased-to-exist-from-the-Universe-Would-nature-change-in-any-way"" rel=""nofollow"">this similar question</a> and find the answers given rather unsatisfactory. I understand that this scenario doesn't really make sense, since if the laws of quantum mechanics still hold then there will necessarily be entanglement, e.g. solving the Schrodinger equation to find the ground state of helium. I don't think this should make it impossible to understand the essence of the question and give some insight into how entanglement affects everyday life (if indeed it does).</p>

<p>Edit: another way of understanding what I mean by this question is ""what processes in my everyday life rely on entanglement?"".</p>

"268619","Stress-energy tensor for Dirac fields, and its dependence on connection","<p>In the stress-energy tensor (SET) for free scalar and vector fields, any references to the connection $\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ in the kinetic terms appear to either be absent ($\nabla_\mu \phi = \partial_\mu \phi$) or cancel each other out ($F_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_\mu A_\nu - \nabla_\nu A_\mu = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$).  This makes sense to me in that one shouldn't need to know the derivatives of the metric/vielbein in order to compute the source of Einstein's field equations (EFE) at a point.  Starting with the symmetrized Lagrangian for a Dirac field, </p>

<p>$$\mathcal L = \frac{i}{2}\bar\psi \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - \frac i2 \bar\psi \overset{\leftarrow}\partial_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi - m \bar\psi\psi,$$</p>

<p>and promoting partial derivatives to covariant derivatives, I get the following form for the SET:</p>

<p>$$ T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{Dirac}} = \frac{i}{2} \bar\psi ( \gamma^\mu \overset\rightarrow\nabla^\nu + \gamma^\nu \overset\rightarrow\nabla^\mu ) \psi - \frac{i}{2} \bar\psi ( \overset\leftarrow\nabla^\nu \gamma^\mu + \overset\leftarrow\nabla^\mu \gamma^\nu ) \psi - g^{\mu\nu} \mathcal L_{\text{Dirac}} $$</p>

<p>In this expression for the SET of a free Dirac field, I can't seem to get the spin connection terms ($\nabla_\mu \psi - \partial_\mu \psi$) in the covariant derivatives to cancel out, so this tensor depends explicitly on the derivatives of the vielbein $e^a_\mu$.  Do those spin connection terms in fact cancel each other out and reduce covariant derivatives to ordinary partial derivatives?</p>

<p>If not, is this not a problem when plugging into Einstein’s field equations?  Since Dirac fields also obey the Klein-Gordon equation, can we write down a Klein-Gordon-like Lagrangian (throwing away information about spin) and use that to compute a connection-independent SET?</p>

"268639","How to calculate the eigenstate of a lattice model in the position space","<p>Say we have a triangular lattice, inside the unit cell there are four sites(label them as a, b, c, d) with different on-site potential energy. What I want to do is find the eigenstate in the position space. The way I am doing is as following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the Fourier transform $a = \sum_{k} a_k e^{i(k_x a_x + k_y a_y)}$(same for b,c,d site) to rewrite the Hamiltonian in momentum basis:$H = \sum_{k}(a^{\dagger}_k b^{\dagger}_k c^{\dagger}_k d^{\dagger}_k)H(k)(a b c d)^{T}$. </li>
<li>I choose the range for kx and ky: $k_x$ in [-10,10], $k_y$ in [-10, 10]. And for each combination of $k_x$ and $k_y$, I use the Bloch Hamiltonian H(k) to calculate the eigenvector.</li>
<li>Since H(k) is a 4 by 4 matrix, I got four eigenvectors.And after I sum up all the eigenvector for each $k_x$ and $k_y$ with a phase using the Fourier transform, I should get 4 4-component vectors which are four eigenstates in the real space.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem comes in the third step. Since I continuously change $k_x$ and $k_y$, the eigenvector should continuously change. But in fact, the eigenvector returned are not in the right order. For example, for $k_x$ and $k_y$, you get a 4 by 4 matrix with each column is the eigenvector. When you increase $k_x$ a little and keep $k_y$ the same, ($k_x + \Delta k_x$, $k_y$), you will get another matrix. However, the first column of the new eigenvector matrix may not be changed continuously from the first column of the first eigenvector matrix, it may from the second and third column of the first eigenvector matrix. </p>

<p>I am wondering how to keep track of the same eigenvector when we continuously change the Hamiltonian. Beside, if there is a better way to calculate the eigenstate in the position basis in the lattice model.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iterations of the renormalization (group) map generate a sequence of points in the space of couplings, which we call a renormalization group trajectory. Since the correlation length is reduced by a factor $b&lt;1$ at each step, a typical renormalization-group trajectory tends to take the system away from criticality. Because the correlation length is infinite at the critical point, it takes an infinite of iterations to leave that point. In general, a system is critical not only at a given point in the coupling space but on a whole ""hypersurface"", which we call the critical surface, or sometimes the critical line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think these remarks are fine. But then the authors give a statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The critical surface is the set of points in coupling space whose renormalization-group trajectories end up at the fixed point:
  $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} T^n(J)=J_c,$$
  where $T$ is the renormalization-group map and $J$ represents the couplings in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is, how to properly understand this statement? For this, I particularly have two small questions. Why the critical line need to hit the fixed point? And why the critical line need to end up at the fixed point rather leave the fixed point under the renormalization group transformation?</p>

"268674","Why do we only detect Minkowski particles?","<p>I'm having trouble building intuition of the Unruh effect, altough I can follow the proof using Bogoliubov transformations.</p>

<p>When studying a massless scalar field in 1+1D QFT, we start from the classical Klein-Gordon equation. We decompose solutions as left and right moving ones (something like $f(x+ct)$ and $g(x-ct)$). We then do a Fourier expansion of both solutions, so they are a sum of Minkowski normal modes: $\exp(-i\omega(x±vt))$. To quantize the theory, we simply promote the Fourier coefficients to creation/annihilation operators, which create and destroy particles.</p>

<p>We could choose another expansion in terms of other modes, $\exp(-i\omega h(x±vt))$ where h is a new function, so a vacuum associated to these modes would contain particles according to Minkowski normal modes.</p>

<p>I don't understand then, what expansion should we choose. I've read that we should choose an expansion in terms of a null coordinate that describes the observer, so positive and negative frequencies don't mix.
Is this choice unique?</p>

<p>To give an example, if we accelerate, we would see photons because the Rindler vacuum is different from the Minkowski vacuum. Does this mean that we could make photomultipliers that don't detect photons when accelerated, but will start clicking at rest?</p>

<p>It seems that a justification that we detect Minkowski particles is that all inertial observers agree on them, but I don't see how this is relevant.</p>

Reading from various textbook, i encountered some textbook use different basis for their gamma matrices. </p>

<p>Gamma matrices are defined such that $\gamma^{a}\gamma^{b}+\gamma^{b}\gamma^{a}=2\eta^{ab}$. Multiplying them in all possible way furnish the following list
\begin{align}
\{ \Gamma^A \} = \{1, \gamma^{a_1}, \gamma^{a_1 a_2}, \cdots \gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_d} \}
\end{align}
with $a_{1}&lt;a_{2}&lt;a_{3}\cdots&lt;a_{d}$.
where $d$ is the dimension of spacetime for given gamma matrices.  </p>

<p>Applying above it for $4d$ i have 
\begin{align}
\{ \Gamma^A \} = \{ 1, \gamma^{a_1}, \gamma^{a_1 a_2}, \gamma^{a_1 a_2 a_3}, \gamma^{a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4} \}
\end{align}</p>

<p>In usual qft textbook, writes 
\begin{align}
\{ \Gamma^A \} = \{1, \gamma_5, \gamma^{a_1}, \gamma_5 \gamma_{a_1}, \gamma_{a_1 a_2} \}
\end{align}</p>

<p>I know they are equivalent, $i.e$, 
\begin{align}

&amp; \gamma_5 \gamma_{a_1} \propto \textrm{three products of gamma}
\end{align}</p>

<p>What i am interested is instead of writing the first one modern qft textbook prefers to write the second form. Is there any reason for that? 
I think it might be just a matter of convention, like eastern or western approach of metric $(-1, 1, 1, \cdots, 1)$, $(1, -1, -1, \cdots -1)$, etc</p>

"268696","Wouldn't the thermodynamic cost of creating alternate universes make the Many Worlds interpretation implausible?","<p>I was thinking about the many interpretations of quantum physics, and one thing that never made sense to me was the many world's interpretation. Basically at any given moment for which something exists in a superposition, isn't this interpretation basically saying that there would have to exist a new universe for every possible discrete outcome that could result once the measurement is made? </p>

<p>So let's say an electron's location is a superposition of two distinct locations. Doesn't that mean there would at that moment have to be two distinct universes for each distinct location that is superposed? If so, then clearly the amount of universes being spawned every moment must be astronomical. </p>

<p>There could be trillions upon trillions of electrons(for instance) having superposed states, and then every moment in time (I suppose every planck time?), it seems there would have to be yet another set of universes spawning for every superposition.</p>

<p>How could this be? Surely there must be some kind of thermodynamic cost to replicate an entire universe. What would fuel or supply the additional mass and energy for every universe at every moment for every superposed state?</p>

<p>To my lay person's mind, this seems to be a very big weakness of this interpretation, but I needed to ask people with the physics background required to answer this question. Could there be some kind of loophole that could allow alternate universes to spawn so rapidly? Otherwise, doesn't this present a bit of a problem for taking this interpretation seriously?</p>

"268698","Compute an object's inertia around an arbitrary axis, using its known values for the x, y and z axes","<p>I need to input inertia data into a bio-mechanical simulation program. I can find inertia data for parts of the human body, around the normal axes.</p>

<p>I know the parallel axis theorem, so I can compute the inertia for the body parts in different locations.</p>

<p>But if the body part is <strong>angled</strong> to the normal axes, can you then compute the inertia, using its known inertia around the x, y and z axes?</p>

<p>Let's say that a human arm and hand has the following inertia values (around its center of gravity)
$$I_x = I_y = 0.3\ kg \cdot m^2$$
$$I_z = 0.02\ kg\cdot m^2$$</p>

<p>This would be the values if the arm is hanging down. But let's say I angle the arm outwards (""abduct"" it) by 30°, can I then use $I_x,\ I_y$ and $I_z$ to find the new values? (As the angle increases, the $I_y$ value would gradually fall and reach the old $I_z$ value at 90°. Is there maybe a trigonometric relation for this??) OK,  I am not a physicist, I only do bio-mechanics occasionally :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 19/7:</strong><br>
Just to clarify:<br>
What I wish to find out is how angling of the body parts affects their inertia. To use a diver that is somersaulting forward as an example : If the diver keeps the arms straight down the body, the values given above would be correct. But the diver can reduce his/her inertia by angling the arms outwards. (You sometimes see divers do that in the pike position.) I wish to compute the inertia for different angles, all for rotation forward. I wish to start with just the body part alone. (After that you can apply the parallel axes theorem.)</p>

<p>I wonder if there could exist a simple trigonometric relationship since one can divide the mass into point mass elements? I can't prove this is the correct answer but I plotted $0.3\cos(\alpha) + 0.02\sin(\alpha)$. It would show how the moment of inertia of the arm, for rotation forward (like in somersaulting), would decrease, as the arm is abducted (by $\alpha^{\circ}$). (In this example the arm alone is ""somersaulting"".) Intuitively it looks ""OK"".</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/Ut8KAzR.png"" alt=""arm inertia on abduction of arm""></p>

<p>(The other alternative is that this can't be computed. You must make a new measurement. But in the case of the arm (looking a little like a rod), I think at least a reasonable estimate could be computed from the x, y and z values.</p>

<p>But what leads me to believe that it is computable, is that you can input $I_x,\ I_y$ and $I_z$ to computer programs and they can compute rotations along oblique axes.)</p>

"268703","Moduli space of torus compactifications","<p>I am trying to understand some general statements made in the lecture notes by Vafa entitled ""<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9702201"" rel=""nofollow"">Lectures on Strings and Dualities</a>"" concerning toroidal compactifications (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9702201"" rel=""nofollow"">arXiv:hep-th/9702201</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: First, consider the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ heterotic string (D = 10) compactified on a torus $T^d$. It is stated on page 12 that the space of inequivalent choices of the left and right- moving momenta $(P_L, P_R)$ is given by the coset</p>

<p>$$\frac{SO(d,d)}{SO(d) \times SO(d) \times O(d,d;\mathbb{Z})}$$</p>

<p>I understand that this is basically $\frac{SO(d,d)}{SO(d) \times SO(d)}$ further modded out by the discrete T-duality group $O(d,d;\mathbb{Z})$ which corresponds to Lorentz boosts with integer coefficients. However, in the main text, it is stated that it is $O(d) \times O(d)$ transformations that do not change the string states. So strictly speaking, shouldn't we be modding $SO(d,d)$ by $O(d) \times O(d)$ instead of $SO(d) \times SO(d)$?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Now consider $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories on $T^d$. </p>

<p>The following statement appears on page 13 about the type-IIA and type-IIB theories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more general compactification on $T^d$ the part of the T-duality group which does not exchange the two theories is $SO(d,d;\mathbb{Z})$; the elements of T-duality which are in $O(d,d;\mathbb{Z})$ but not in $SO(d,d;
\mathbb{Z})$ will exchange IIA and IIB and thus are not symmetries of either one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So does this mean that the T-duality group consists of transformations that do take IIA to IIB (and vice-versa) but also transformations that do not take IIA to IIB and that the former correspond to $O(d,d;\mathbb{Z}) \setminus SO(d,d;\mathbb{Z})$? So when textbooks make statements like $IIA \leftrightarrow IIB$ under T-duality, they really mean under this set theoretic subtraction?</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong>: This question, somewhat embarrasingly, is more about notation than physics. On page 13 of the same lecture notes, the following paragraph appears:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In compactifying type II strings on tori, the scalars parametrized by the coset $SO(d,d)/SO(d) \times SO(d)$ correspond to choices of the metric of the torus ($d(d+1)/2$ degrees of freedom) and the antisymmetric field $B_{ij}$ on the torus ($d(d-)1/2$ degrees of freedom).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, does the author mean $\frac{SO(d,d)}{SO(d) \times SO(d)}$ or does he mean $(SO(d,d)/SO(d)) \times SO(d)$, i.e. $\frac{SO(d,d)}{SO(d)} \times SO(d)$? The two are vastly different things.</p>

<p>In fact, often he refers to things like $SO(5,5)/SO(5) \times SO(5)$ or $SO(5,5)/SO(5) \times SO(5) \times SO(5,5;\mathbb{Z})$. <strong>What is the order in which these are to be read/interpreted?</strong></p>

"268710","Intuitive explanation for uniform electric field between capacitor plates","<p>Could anyone explain why the intensity of the electric field between plates of a charged capacitor is constant? Moreover, the varying the distance between plates doesn't change the electric field intensity - that's weird, because the electric field is defined as the force acting on a unit charge, and the force according to Coulomb law certainly does depend on the distance between the charges.</p>

<p>So it's reasonable to expect that placing two plates further apart would result in a lower electric field intensity (or, lower force experienced by a unit charge placed between the plates), but that's not the case (for some reason).</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/viz/EM/visualizations/coursenotes/modules/guide04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">example 4.2</a> if you need technical details.</p>

<p>Let's say the value of charge, not potential, is fixed on both plates. Does the electric field insensity change with the distance between the plates? The answer has to be 'no', because doubling the distance between plates of a capacitor doubles the voltage across them (and $V=Ed$). And if the electric field intensity remains constant (it's just force acting on unit charge), then the force acting on the test charge will be the same no matter how far apart the plates are.</p>

"268752","Why are parallel spins energetically favorable for nucleons?","<p>For deuterium, both the proton and neutron preferentially occupy $1s_{1/2}$ orbitals which have orbital angular momentum $l=0$ and spin $s=1/2$. By coupling their orbital and spin angular momenta for a new conserved quantum value $j$, one gets a spin of $1/2$ for each particle. j-j coupling then leads to either a $I=1$ or $I=0$ total nuclear spin corresponding to symmetric and anti-symmetric spin states respectively. Since the the spatial wavefunctions for the s orbitals are each of even parity, their coupled wavefunctions would be expected to be of even parity as well. So, exchanging each of the nucleons would spatially symmetric. It is theorized that deuterium represents an anti-isymmetric isospin state. Thus the total wavefunction would be anti-symmetric in the spin one state which apparently is the only bound state for deuterium. The total wavefunction being symmetric in the spin 0 state would violate spin-statistics theorem.</p>

<p>It is also known that even-even nuclei have protons that pair with protons and neutrons that pair with neutrons. These pairings involve identical particles and coupling their identical spatial wavefunctions would lead to even parity and hence be spatially symmetric under exchange. Isospin being symmetric, their combined spins would need to be anti-symmetric to avoid violating spin statistics. Which is why these nuclei have total spin $I=0$.</p>

<p>If one were to set aside isospin considerations, the proton and neutron in the deuterium are distinct particles (their masses are not the same), so their angular momentum can be coupled to a spin one or a spin zero state without violating spin-statistics. It appears that the spin one (parallel spins) state is energetically more favorable and in fact is the only bound state, with singlet state unbounded and dissociated. However, with even-even nuclei, the pairings involve identical particles so the energetically more favorable spin one state is blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle.</p>

<p>So my question is there a way to explain without invoking the concept of isospin, why neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairings in even-even nuclei have anti-symmetric spins whereas the deuterium nucleons pair up with symmetric spins. </p>

"268754","Can we make high acceleration safe to our bodies thanks to this gravity trick?","<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force#Human_tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>, a human body can resist g-force of about $5 g$. It can be a greater value in some circumstances, but even as low as $2 g$ would be unpleasant after several seconds. This means our bodies set rather low limit to manned space travel. Even if we built a spaceship that could accelerate steady with $20 g$, it would be fatal to its crew.</p>

<p>We know that it's not the acceleration itself that is harmful; internal forces inside our bodies are. When a pilot experiences $5 g$, the force comes from their seat, through compressed skin and flesh; then the bones apply forces to every other pieces of flesh, they ""feel"" the flesh inertia; the heart builds pressure to accelerate blood; the skull pushes the brain, the brain pushes the skull; and so on. These forces create the impression of acceleration and may be harmful. Yet if accelerating forces were applied directly to every particle, the pilot would feel nothing. Gravity works this way. In free falling we experience zero-g even though we accelerate towards the Earth (or another body) according to a distant observer.</p>

<p>This observation led me to following concept:</p>

<pre><code> .-------. /==
 | engine &lt;===   everything accelerates
 '-------' \==        to the left
   | |
  /   \
 /     \
/ large \        free falling
| mass  |     .  passenger craft,
\   M   /        small mass m
 \     /
  \   /
   | |
 .-------. /==
 | engine &lt;===
 '-------' \==
</code></pre>

<p>The manned craft of mass $m$ falls freely towards unmanned large mass $M$. Engines accelerate $M$ just enough for the distance between the two masses to remain constant. There is of course some force from $m$ that pulls $M$ to the right. The engines act against this, so in fact they accelerate $M+m$. It's no surprise, no magic. Gravitational pull between $M$ and $m$ might be replaced by a rope or another structure that would connect the engines to the passenger craft.</p>

<p>The difference is: with the rope we have a force applied to a joint, then fuselage, its structure, seats, flesh, skeleton – all those harmful forces that can make screws break and lungs collapse. With gravity we have free fall, no tensions, no harm done.</p>

<p>I'm not asking about engines, energy source, tidal forces, economy etc. Let's assume we can build and power this set of crafts, even if $M$ should be of planetary scale.</p>

<p><strong>Primary questions: Will passengers experience zero-g regardless of the whole set acceleration as I expect? or am I missing something? Do Newton's and Einstein's answers differ here?</strong></p>

<p>Secondary questions: Has the concept already been discussed by scientists? What is its name (if any)?</p>

"268755","How do I calculate a upward-pulling force on a swinging pendulum?","<p>I'm trying to implement a simple pendulum using a 2d physics system that can model rigid bodies with gravity. The problem is that I don't know how to calculate the upward-pulling force of the rope, as in this image:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/dlAfhvS.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>I've only found equations for calculating velocity of the pendulum, as shown on wikipedia, but the problem is that I can't change the velocity directly, as I need to be applying a force.</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Oscillating_pendulum.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The problem is probably just the magnitude of the force vector. Since in the idle position the upward force is equal to negative gravity, I thought I could simply take something like $cos(\theta) \cdot v \cdot G$ where $v$ is the pendulum vector and G is gravity magnitude, but that doesn't work in my simulation.</p>

"268756","Schrödinger's Equation with multi-part potential","<p>I have this potential</p>

<p>$$V(x) =
\left\{
 \begin{array}{ll}
  \infty  &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; -a \\
  \frac{V_o}{a}x &amp; \mbox{if } -a \leq x \leq a \\
       V_o &amp; \mbox{if } x \geq a \
 \end{array} 
\right.$$</p>

<p>And I want to know, qualitatively, how the wave function would look like.</p>

<p>So, the particle cannot live at the left of the ""wall"" at $x=-a$, so the wave fucntion there is $0$. To the left of the ramp (i.e., for $x&gt;a$), the potential is constant, so the particle will behave like a free one. Namely, the wave function will be constant in that zone.</p>

<p>But what happens in the middle? I'm not interested in the mathematical approach for this, I've already looked it up and it seems to be related with Airy functions or something like that. However, I want to <em>understand</em> what would happen, not just do the math. I think that the wave function in this zone will depend on the value of $E$ the particle has.</p>

<p>This is what I thought: for low values of energy, the particle will have a small probability of getting trough the ramp (tunneling?); on the other hand, for high values of energy ($E&gt;V_o$ I suppose), the probability of the particle living in the zone with the constant potential would be higher, as the ""box"" in the middle wouldn't be able to contain it.</p>

<p>My guess is that if $E&lt;V_o$ the wave function would look like a sine wave atenuated along the $x$-axis until it reaches $x=a$, where it would become constant. If $E&gt;V_o$, it would be the same but with the sine wave increasing its amplitude this time.</p>

<p>Is this reasoning correct? Or any other form of thinking about it?</p>

"268814","System of point charges, work to move one of the systems point charge around","<p>Suppose we have an electron at $\vec{x}_1=(0,a,0)$ and a proton at $\vec{x}_(a,0,0)$. Now i want to move the proton to the point $\vec{x}_3 = (0,0,0)$ and want to know how much work do i need for that.
I thought of the system not of system of two point charges but as the Proton in the electric field of the electron. 
So considering,
$$\phi(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{e}{\|\vec{x}-\vec{x}_1\|}$$ the potential of the electron at $\vec{x}$ I can calculate:
$$\triangle W = e \cdot (\phi(\vec{x}_3)-\phi(\vec{x}_2)) = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a} \left( 1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$$

I am slightly confused if I can view a two point charge system as a one point charge system and I couldn't find an answer in any of my books.

<p>$$ {\cal L} ~=~{\cal L}_{\rm Maxwell} + {\cal L}_{\rm matter} , $$</p>

<p>1) Using global gauge symmetry and matter field equations of motion, or</p>

<p>2) Using local gauge symmetry and gauge field equations of motion.</p>

<p>This has been discussed at many places but let me provide few links for those who want to check it more thoroughly: see <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/66092/noether-charge-of-local-symmetries?answertab=votes#tab-top"">here</a> and <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/159273/classical-em-clear-link-between-gauge-symmetry-and-charge-conservation?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now here is my first question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any way to proceed in the reverse direction? i.e. Using continuity equation and gauge invariance to derive field equations?. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: maybe extra symmetries (like Lorentz symmetry) are needed to build up the action itself, suppose we know them and we use them in both directions for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>Based on Noether's general identity presented <a href=""https://www3.nd.edu/~kbrading/Research/WhichSymmetryStudiesJuly01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0009058v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> it seems that the answer to my question is yes. However, I'm not sure!.</p>

<p>In fact I'm trying to see the <strong>minimum number</strong> of independent assumptions from which we can construct the whole electrodynamics (Considering the lorentz force law as a separate assumption itself-see <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/15443/do-we-need-maxwells-equations-since-they-fail-to-account-for-an-experimental-fa"">here</a>) plus charge conservation. It seems to me taking gauge invariance (and probably some other symmetries) and conservation of charge as our independent postulate is a good candidate. </p>

<p>When I was searching I accidentally  found <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.5041.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">very interesting paper</a> in which the author has derived Maxwell's equations from continuity equation. He uses a few extra assumptions to do it though. Here are the extra assumptions as the author himself describes them in the conclusion part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can be argued that other physical assumptions like the use of the Minkowski spacetime with its speed of light c and its associated retarded Green function G are ingredients implicit in the covariant derivation of Maxwell’ equations presented here. However, if we first postulate the validity of the continuity equation in any four-space, the particular use of the Minkowski spacetime (together with its associated retarded Green function G and speed c)
  would not really be a new postulate, but merely an application of our initial postulate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we reach my second question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess that if the answer to my first question is yes, then the extra assumptions of the author are(should!) be equivalent to gauge invariance(plus other symmetries that we use in my first question). And it seems highly counter intuitive to me!. Why should anything related to Minkowski space be related to gauge invariance?!</p>

<p>About the possible duplicate: I want to know about charges in general, not just that of an electron.</p>

<p>My response to <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/268834/15916"">Lawrence B. Crowell's answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you very much for the extensive explanation. Unfortunately it's a bit above my level (I'm a first year electrical engineering bachelor student). This is how I understand it: If the charge is the sum of multiple separate charges, there has to be an external force that keeps this charges together.</p>
  
  <p>However we most often think of electrons and protons as point charges. In other words, we don't think of them as if they are made up from different (smaller) parts.</p>
  
  <p>But the idea of electrons and protons as point charges has its own problems. I didn't know that the electric field has a mass. From the formula, I understand that $m\propto \frac{1}{r}$. This would mean that $m\rightarrow \infty$ as $r \rightarrow 0$ (or $r = 0$), which of course is physically not possible.</p>
  
  <p>But there is a way to calculate the radius of an electron based on the mass, the speed of light and the constant of Planck. (Unfortunately I don't know why.)</p>
  
  <p>You can get around this by a technique called called renormalization, which causes the integral to converge.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, I don't understand the rest of the answer due to my level in physics. Nevertheless I am grateful for you answer. It would be awesome if you could confirm or correct my understanding.</p>

<p>By trying to answer it myself , I can see that the separability test is based on an <em>existential quantifier</em>, namely trying to prove that $\exists v_1, v_2 \in \mathcal{H}^{\otimes 2} $ such that $v_1 \otimes v_2 = v $. </p>

<p>The entanglement test on the other hand is based on a <em>universal quantifier</em>, $$\forall v_1, v_2 \in \mathcal{H}^{\otimes 2}, v_1 \otimes v_2 \neq v.$$ So, this reasoning  could suggest that entangled vectors are much more scarce than separable ones because it is easier to find one simple example (existential) that satisfies the condition than to check for every single one (universal). </p>

<p>This result would make sense physically since entanglement is a valuable resource so, intuitively, it should be scarce.</p>

<p>The yesterday report on ATLAS claims new analysis and new methods gave promising result, which is what I'm looking forward to know. Also I would like some experts to give an introduction to the physics picture how to examine the spin, and what's the theoretical model [4] means. </p>

<p>Edit2: on Aug 5th, ICHEP conference, the new result is gonna to be published. </p>

<p>Edit3: ICHEP conference released ATLAS &amp; CMS results [5-6]. ATLAS doesn't contain newest spin-2 selection results (which could be something), while CMS gives disappointing results. </p>

If the bottom of the cylinder is at sea level, what is the temperature at the top of the cylinder when the system reaches equilibrium?</p>

<p>As we know, hot air rises and cold air sinks. So it stands to reason that the bottom will be cooler then the top in a very tall air column. However is there a formula?</p>

<li><p>In thermodynamics, what is a phase? </p></li>
<li><p>Imagine a container full of air where the walls of this container are adiabatic and there is a piston on the top of it. If we push the piston downwards, the pressure increases while the volumes decreases. But what happens to temperature? If we're transferring energy as work, this energy would increase the kinetic energy of air particles, so the temperature would increase. So, the pressure and volume aren't inversely proportional, right? One increase, and the other increase, but we can't forget that temperature changes.

"268886","Can one rise through a free-falling rope?","<p>I am a little confused about this question. I cannot imagine that it is possible to rise through a rope (assuming inextensible) that isn't fixed in its upper end. But when I solve this problem, I see that it is possible.
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2q05R.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2q05R.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
If the person exerts downwards force of $F$ on the rope, according to the third law of Newton, the rope will exert a force by the same magnitude but in the opposite direction on the person. So, his acceleration ($a_m$) will be:
$$a_m=\frac Fm-a_M$$
That $a_M$ is the magnitude of the acceleration of the rope.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have:
$$a_M=g+\frac FM$$
Thus,
$$a_m=F\left(\frac 1m-\frac 1M\right)-g$$
Now, if $F\left(\frac 1m-\frac 1M\right)\ge g$, then $a_m\ge 0$ and this means that it is possible to rise through a free-falling rope.</p>

<p>But I suspect I am missing something (maybe because of overthinking!) because the upper end of the rope is free and I wonder if it is possible to rise!</p>

"268891","Born's interpretation for momentum operator","<p>Hi I have a basic QM question: Given a state vector $|\psi(t) \rangle$, at some time $t$, we can project this onto the position basis, $\langle \vec{r}| \psi(t) \rangle = \psi(\vec{r},t)$. Then from Born's probabilistic interpretation, the square of the norm $$|\psi(\vec{r},t)|^2$$ represents the probability density at a time $t$ of finding the particle at in a volume $d^3r$ located between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{r} + d \vec{r}$. </p>

<p>Consider the the momentum eigenvector $|p\rangle$, by projecting this onto the position basis we get $\langle \vec{r}| \vec{p} \rangle = Ae^{\frac{i \cdot \vec{p}\cdot \vec{r}}{\hbar}} = \psi(\vec{r})$. Does it follow that $|\psi(\vec{r})|^2d^3r$ gives the probability of finding the particle with momentum $\vec{p}$ in the volume element $d^3r$? If so, is this a separate postulate or does it follow from Borns postulate or something else?  </p>

The interesting thing as that the system has a beat frequency where the gyroscope will point along the line of the pendulum as it swings, but this shifts to near zero pendulum motion as the gyroscope precesses around its anchor. It then oscillates between these two configurations. If you have a toy gyroscope try this out, it is rather interesting.</p>

<p>I sat down to work the Lagrangian of this. I am prodding SE here to see if anyone else can work this out as well. This is a classical system that emulates the Jaynes-Cumming model of a two state atom with a photon confinced in a QED cavity.

"268899","Quantum Logic Gates","<p>In classical computation, a bit can have the value of either 1 or 0 and one can apply a logic gate to this bit. As far as I understand, in classical computation, no matter what gate is used, the value must still be either 1 or 0. I understand that before measurement, a qubit can exist in a superposition of states, but that once it has been measured, it too must either produce the value of 1 or 0. However, it appears that there are many quantum logic gates that will operate on a qubit and produce a value that is not necessarily 1 or 0 (i.e. it the Z gate will change the value of 1 t0 -1). So, are we simply changing the basis? Furthermore what is the advantage or having all of these values that a qubit can be in, rather than simply the binary?</p>

"268900","Speed of electricity in a tangled wire","<p>Most sources claim that the speed of electricity in a wire (or signal/information speed) is the EM wave propagation speed of the metal.</p>

<p>What about tangled wires? Am I correct in assuming that for the signal to pass a sharp turn in a wire, electrons need to accumulate there to make the ""signal pass""? As electrons travel very slowly compared to the EM wave propagation, surely this adds a lot of delay to the signal?</p>

<p>Edit: made some pictures. In the initial moment, when connecting the wire, there's electric field at point 1, but none at points 2 and 3. When electrons accumulate on the first turn, there will be electric field in point 2 and so on. Is this understanding correct? Or is it more to do with EM waves somehow reflecting through the wire and no electron accumulation?</p>

<p>What I did: I assume the pendelum is at start in the $y'z'$ plane ($K'$ moves and turns with the earth and $K$ moves with the earth but doesnt turn), then I say the ‎oscillation behaves like $$y'=Acos(\Omega t),$$ so I'll get with the coriolis-'force' $$\ddot{x'}(t)=-2A\Omega\omega\sin\phi\sin\Omega t$$ where $\phi$ is the ‎degree of latitude and $\omega$ is the earths angular velocity. For half a period (of oscillation) I get (by integrating 2 times) $$\delta x' = -A\omega\sin\phi T.$$ Then I just calculate $$N=\frac{2\pi A}{2|\delta x'|}=\frac{\Omega}{2\omega sin\phi}.$$ Now I would guess the mistake is in the very last calculation where $N=...$ My thinking was: in a half period the pendelum moves $\delta x'$ from its original plane, so in a full period it moves $2\delta x'$ and if it comes back to the start it moved $2\pi A$ (perpendicular to its 'normal' path).</p>

"268921","Is there any primordial gravitational wave(form) that could explain dark energy?","<p>First, I asked myself the question:
Is there <em>any</em> gravitational waveform, however fantastical, that could explain dark energy.</p>

<p>I suppose for a ubiquitous gravitational wave to be an explanation for dark energy, then it would have to have the same effect:
Dark energy produces a repulsive force at every point in the universe.
What kind of primordial gravitational 'wave' could effectively produce a repulsive force at every point in the universe?</p>

<p>Please point out any absurdity in this thought experiment:</p>

<ul>
<li>a gravitational wave must propagate at the speed of light</li>
<li>if the wave was/is produced by the big bang itself, the source of the gravitational wave comes from every direction, and is nearly uniform in every direction.</li>
<li>I’m thinking along the lines of a single giant, long period gravitational wave, amplitude of up to 10^N meters (the size of the universe), and a wavelength of ~ 8 billion years.</li>
<li>a wavelength of ~ 8 billion years doesn’t really make sense, unless you say that <strong>due to the inflationary epoch</strong>, its wavelength is being stretched out.</li>
<li>gravitational waves are complex 3 dimensional waves... however:

<ul>
<li>because it comes from every direction for any observer, the ‘stretching’ of spacetime happens evenly in every direction radially.  I'm thinking of a polar coordinate system.</li>
<li>stretching in the other polar dimensions are cancelled out from any observer’s point of view, again since the wave is coming from every direction radially.</li>
<li>Maybe there is a flaw here... would the wave also cancel out in the radial dimension itself?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since it was/is produced by the big bang itself, its ’source’ is ~380,000 years beyond the observable universe’s event horizon (i.e. 380,000 years beyond the cosmic background radiation).  Again, its wavelength stretched out because of inflation.</li>

"268923","How can the size of the universe change over time when time is part of the universe?","<p>Bit of an awkward way to phrase it, but basically:</p>

<p>Time in relativity is just one of four dimensions of space-time. Nothing really special about it. Yet the universe was once smaller than it is now and has evolved, changed, from a singularity till its size today.</p>

<p>But this implies that the whole of space-time (since you can't separate time from space) is evolving <em>over time</em>. Which <em>time</em>, then, is it evolving over? There's not supposed to be a global time for the universe, only time as perceived for an observer at a particular location. </p>

<p>So it seems very strange to me that the volume of the entire universe's space-time could change <em>over time</em> when time is part of the thing that's changing. It sounds like we're talking about two different kinds of time...</p>

"268927","Calculating the product state capacity of the quantum depolarizing channel","<p>This is homework, so just let me know <strike>if I'm on the right track or</strike> where I went wrong, please.</p>

<p>So, we are asked to compute the product state capacity 
$$C_1(T) = \max_{\{p_j,\,\vert \psi_j\rangle\}}\left[ S\left(\sum_j p_j T(\vert \psi_j\rangle\langle \psi_j\vert)\right) - \sum_j p_jS(T(\vert \psi_j\rangle\langle \psi_j\vert))\right]$$
of the depolarizing channel $T(\rho)\equiv(1-p)\rho + p\frac{1}{d}\textbf{I}$ in $d$ dimensions. </p>

<p>Here is how I proceded:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>See that for each pure state $\vert \psi\rangle$, we could write 
$$ T(\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert) \doteq \text{diag}\left(1-p + \frac{p}{d},\frac{p}{d},\ldots,\frac{p}{d}\right),$$</p></li>
<li><p>which would then lead to

\right]$$</p></li>
<li><p>Further, by the same token as in 1., we get
$$
\sum_x q_x T(\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert)\doteq
(1-p)\,\text{diag}\left(\sum_x q_x \lvert\langle\psi_x\vert 1\rangle \rvert^2,\ldots,\sum_x q_x \lvert\langle\psi_x\vert d\rangle \rvert^2
\right)+p\frac{1}{d}\textbf{I}.
$$</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, we need to maximize the expression
\begin{align}
&amp;-\sum_{i=1}^d\left[(1-p)\sum_x q_x \lvert\langle\psi_x\vert i\rangle \rvert^2 + \frac{p}{d}\right]\cdot\log\left((1-p)\sum_x q_x \lvert\langle\psi_x\vert i\rangle \rvert^2 + \frac{p}{d}\right)\\
&amp;+\left(1-p+\frac{p}{d}\right)\log\left(1-p+\frac{p}{d}\right) + \frac{d-1}{d}p\log\left(\frac{p}{d}\right)

"268934","Existence of stationary solutions to the Liouville equation for the harmonic oscillator","<p>So I was trying to solve the Liouville equation, which for the classical harmonic oscillator in one dimension looks like this:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} + \frac{p}{m} \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial x} - m \omega^2 x \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial p} = 0$$</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm interested in stationary solutions, where the phase space distribution function $\rho$ is independent of time, so that $\partial \rho/ \partial t=0$. Well, I noticed that by scaling the position coordinate with the new variable $q=m \omega x$, we obtain:</p>

<p>$$p \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial q} - q \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial p} = 0$$</p>

<p>Now, dividing by $pq$ yields:</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{q} \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial q} - \frac{1}{p} \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial p} = \frac{\partial \ln \rho }{\partial q} - \frac{\partial \ln \rho }{\partial p}= 0$$</p>

<p>This equation has the general solution $\ln \rho(x,p) = f(q +p) = f(m \omega x +p)$, and so $\rho(x,p) = g(m \omega x +p)$, where $f(s)$ and $g(s)=\exp(f(s))$ are arbitrary functions. However, it appears that this solution is not normalizable as a probability density function over phase space (assuming that both $x$ and $p$ can take on any real value). This is because the solution $\rho(x,p) = g(m \omega x +p)$ is constant for fixed values of $m \omega x +p$, so $\rho(x,p)$ does not decay to zero for arbitrarily large values of $x$ and $p$ along these lines of constant $\rho(x,p)$, unless the function $g(s)$ is zero everywhere.</p>

<p>So these are my questions: Is this analysis correct, implying that there are no stationary physical solutions to the Liouville equation for the harmonic oscillator, or is there some class of solutions that I've missed? And if so, is this just a peculiarity of the harmonic oscillator, or is there some general class of problems for which no stationary solutions to the Liouville equation can be found?</p>

<p>During lectures my professor didn't talked about possible representation of this space and what type of product is the one between the two spinors in the base we constructed.</p>

<p>I made some research and I've found out that this product is the tensor product between vector spaces which became the kronecker product in case of finite-dimension space.
I applied this product to the base vectors and I've found this representation for the composite system:
$$
\chi_+(1)\chi_+(2) = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0 \end{pmatrix} \quad 
\chi_+(1)\chi_-(2) = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\0 \end{pmatrix} \quad 
\chi_-(1)\chi_+(2) = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0 \end{pmatrix} \quad 
\chi_-(1)\chi_-(2) = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1 \end{pmatrix} 
$$</p>

<p>which seemed to me pretty reasonable.
Now I was trying to find a representation for the spin operators in this space but applying the kroneker product to the $\hat{S}_z$ operators in the two dimension space with itself:
$$
\hat{S}_z \otimes \hat{S}_z = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp;-1 &amp;0 &amp;0\\0&amp; 0 &amp;-1 &amp;0\\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}
$$</p>

<p>But the correct operator should be:
$$
 \hat{S}_z = \hbar \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0\\0&amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp;0\\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;-1\end{pmatrix}
$$</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I correctly build the representation of a composite system starting from the one of a single particle space?</p>

"268941","Principle of Least Action Question","<p>Let's say we have a particle with no forces on it. The path that this classical particle takes is the one that minimizes the integral 
$$\frac{1}{2}m\int_{t_i}^{t_f}v^2dt.$$ 
So if we graph this for the actual path a particle takes it is a straight, horizontal line on the $(t,v^2)$ plane. But couldn't we lessen the integral if we first slow down and then speed up near the end to create a sort of parabolic line that has less area under the $(t,v^2)$ plane? So why doesn't the particle take this path? What am I missing in my thinking?</p>

"268946","Transforming Qubits Into Bits","<p>From what I understand, a qubit exists in a superposition of states and once it has been measured, it must fall into one of the two possible states. Now, I have been told that once a qubit is measured, it is no longer proper to call it a qubit but a bit since it no longer exists in a superposition of states. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Along the same lines, if a photon with unknown polarization (the polarization state can be our qubit) hits a polarizing beam splitter, then its no longer exists in a superposition of states but must be either horizontally or vertically polarized. So would this mean that the polarization no longer is a qubit, but a bit, since it can only exist in one of two states? This would not make sense because many regimes for experimentally realizing quantum logic gates involve polarizing beam splitters. So if my reasoning is correct, that would mean that in the gate itself the qubit actually is no longer a qubit, but a bit.</p>

<p>One final thing, since measuring a qubit is inherent to a functional quantum computer, does this mean that quantum computers actually use bits as well as qubits?</p>

<p>Would it be sufficient to draw a very thin Gaussian pillbox of height $\epsilon$. We take the limit as $\epsilon \to 0$, the sides sides then don't contribute to the flux, we have:

But then how can you detect the onset of superfluidity, in which the ground state becomes a phase-coherent state that is a linear combination of all possible bosonic occupation numbers, even arbitrarily high ones?

<blockquote>
  <p>Emslie, Alfred G., Francis T. Bonner, and Leslie G. Peck. “Flow of a Viscous Liquid on a Rotating Disk.” Journal of Applied Physics 29, no. 5 (1958): 858. doi:10.1063/1.1723300.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the authors derive an equation for the $z$ dependence of the radial velocity of a viscous liquid. The question is how did the authors arrive at equation (1) and how they arrived at the second derivative?</p>

<p>Experimental setup: there is a rotating disk with a certain angular velocity $\omega$ with some viscous liquid on top of the disk. Upon spinning, the liquid spreads over the disk, lowering in thickness. There is a centrifugal force acting in the outward direction, and a viscous force acting in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Given this setup, equation (1) of the paper says,</p>

<p>$$
-\eta  \frac{\partial^2v}{\partial z^2} = \rho \omega^2r
$$</p>

<p>where the variables are defined in cylindrical polar coordinates $ (r,\theta,z) $, as follows: $\eta$ is the viscosity; $v$ is the radial velocity of the liquid, which is dependent on $z$; $\rho$ is the density of the fluid and $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the rotating disk. The authors equate the viscous force and the centrifugal force per unit volume.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity#Dynamic_.28shear.29_viscosity"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that the viscous force is $F_V=\mu A \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$, where $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ($\eta$ can also be used), $A$ is the plate area, $u$ is the speed of the fluid moving between two parallel plates and $y$ is the separation between plates. Converting those variables to the rotating disk case, $u$ becomes $v$ and $y$ becomes $z$. Therefore, the same formula becomes: $F_V=\eta A \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}$.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.nzifst.org.nz/unitoperations/mechseparation4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that the centrifugal force is $F_C=m \omega ^2/r$.</p>

<p>By equating the two formulas, $$-\frac{F_V}{V}=\frac{F_C}{V}$$ where $V$ is the volume, 
$$-\eta \frac{A}{V}\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}=\frac{m}{V}\omega^2r$$
$\frac{m}{V}$ is the density $\rho$ and $V=Ah$, so $\frac{A}{V}$ becomes $\frac{1}{h}$, where $h$ is the height.</p>

<p>Therefore,
$$-\eta \frac{1}{h}\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}=\rho\omega^2r$$</p>

<p>How did the authors arrive at the second derivative? Also, $h$ could be $z$?</p>

"268997","A problem in an integration related to Wick rotation","<p>In quantum field theory, we often calculate some integrations using Wick rotation. In the following, I will carefully deal with an integration involving Wick rotation. In the end, I have found that I was confused.</p>

<p>The integration is
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &amp;  &amp; \int\frac{d^{4}k}{(2\pi)^{4}}\frac{1}{k^{2}+i\epsilon}e^{-ik\cdot x}\\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{4}}\int d^{3}ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dk_{0}\frac{1}{k_{0}^{2}-(E_{k}-i\epsilon)^{2}}e^{-ik_{0}t}\\
 &amp; \equiv &amp; \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{4}}\int d^{3}ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}\times\mathrm{I}
\end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>with
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{I} &amp; = &amp; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dk_{0}\frac{1}{k_{0}^{2}-a^{2}}e^{-ik_{0}t}\\
a &amp; = &amp; E_{k}-i\epsilon=\sqrt{m^{2}+\mathbf{k}^{2}}-i\epsilon
\end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>Now we will use Wick rotation to calculate $\mathrm{I}$. Note that
$\pm a$ are two singularities of the integrand. Consider following
contour. The radii of coutours $l_{5},l_{6}$ are both $R$ and $R\rightarrow\infty$.</p>

\begin{eqnarray*}

 &amp;  &amp; \bigg[\text{note: set }z=ik_{E}^{0}\text{ in }l_{3},l_{4}\text{ and combine }l_{5},l_{6}\bigg]\\

 &amp; \equiv &amp; (-i)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dk_{E}^{0}\frac{1}{(k_{E}^{0})^{2}+a^{2}}e^{tk_{E}^{0}}+\mathrm{II}

"269021","What is the mass and density distribution of a Schwarzchild black hole in the viewpoint of distant observer?","<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric"" rel=""nofollow"">Schwarzschild metric:</a> </p>

<p>$$ c^2~\mathrm d\tau^2 = \left(1-\frac{r_s}{r}\right)c^2 ~\mathrm dt^2 - \left(1-\frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}~\mathrm dr^2 - r^2\left(\mathrm d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta~\mathrm d\varphi^2 \right) $$</p>

<p>,where $r_s$ is Schwarzschild radius: $ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $</p>

<p>the density element $$ \rho(r) = \frac{\mathrm dm}{\mathrm dV} $$ becomes infinite on the event horizon if there is mass $$ \mathrm dm(r) &gt; 0, r \rightarrow r_s, r&gt;r_s $$very near at the outside of event horizon.</p>

<p>The density is then:</p>

<p>$$ \delta(r)_\infty = \frac{\mathrm dm_{r,\infty}}{\mathrm dV_{r,\infty}} = \frac{\mathrm dm_{r,\infty}}{(1-\frac{r_s}{r})^{1/2}(r~\mathrm dr~\mathrm  d\theta ~\sin\theta~\mathrm  d\varphi)} = \frac{\mathrm dm_{r,\infty}}{~\mathrm dV_{\infty,\infty} }\left(\sqrt{\frac{r}{r-r_s}}\right) $$</p>

<p>and at the limit $r \rightarrow r_s$:
$$ \delta(r)_{\infty}\to \infty , \text{when}~ (r \rightarrow r_s)~\text{and}~ (\mathrm dm_{r,\infty} &gt; 0 ) $$</p>

<p>Note that this equation does not yet describe the density distribution. The mass element $$ \mathrm dm_{r,\infty} $$ is the mass inside volume element $$\mathrm  dV_{r,\infty} $$. In this equation, this can be anywhere between 0 and </p>

<p>$$ \text{max}(\mathrm dm_{r,\infty}) = \frac{M}{A_{BH}}= \frac{M}{4 \pi r_s^2} = \frac{c^4}{16\pi G^2M} $$</p>

<p>,where the maximum is in the situation when all of the mass of BH is concentrated into very thin layer above the event horizon. minimum 0 is the situation that all of the mass is inside the event horizon and none outside of it.</p>

<p>The Schwarzschild metric describes only the metric of spacetime outside of the Black Hole event horizon, not inside.</p>

<p><strong>Birkhoff's theorem</strong> states that spacetime in the outerior of non-rotating thin spherical shell has Schwarzchild metric. And the interior of thin spherical shell has flat Minkowsky metric </p>

<p>$$ds^2 = c^2dt^2 - (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)$$ </p>

<p>And according to this theorem the interior metric of spherical mass distribution depends only on the spherical mass distribution that is inside the radius r. For example Spherical mass distribution with constant density has following metric:</p>

<p>$$ds^2 = -(1-\frac{2M(r)}{r})c^2dt^2 + (1 -\frac{2M(r)}{r})^{-1} dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + sin^2\theta d\rho^2)$$</p>

<p>I don't know at the moment what is the general solution for interior metric of spherical mass distribution, but i have a guess that it depends largely on the equation of state of the matter, that determines what kind of density and pressure distribution the matter will eventually have when it is in dynamical and thermical equilibrium.</p>

<p><strong>My question is, what do we know about the mass distribution of density distribution of the black hole if it is observed by distant observer?</strong> In other words, what are $$ \delta(r) , m(r) $$ of the ideal Schwarzschild Black Hole, if it is observed by observer that is infinitely far away from BH?</p>

<p>I see here two different kind of possiblities for BH mass distribution:</p>

<ol>
<li>All or some of the mass is concentrated into very thin layer above the event horizon, when the density distribution is (more or less): $$ \rho (r) \rightarrow \delta (r_s) = \left \{ +\infty ,when r = r_s,= 0, when r &gt; r_s \right \} $$ </li>
<li>All of the mass is inside the event horizon,when the density distribution is:
$$ \rho (r) = 0 , when r \geqslant r_s $$
One possibility could be that all of the BH mass is concentrated into a very thin layer above the event horizon, and that there is no mass inside the event horizon. The reason why I think that it is possible is that the time dilation of BH becomes near infinity just above the horizon relative to the clock that is infinitely far away from the black hole and the matter stops falling down for this reason, if it is observed by observer that is far away from the black hole. Also the falling objects have nearly infinite radial length contraction relative to the metric infinitely far away from BH.</li>
</ol>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{\tau_r }{\tau_\infty }\right) = \sqrt{1-\frac{r_s}{r}} \to 0, ~\text{when}~ (r \to r_s ) $$</p>

<p>$$ \left (  \frac{dr_{r}}{dr_{\infty}}\right ) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_s}{r}}\rightarrow 0, when (r\rightarrow r_s) $$</p>

<p>I am not sure what happens to the matter of BH in the birth of the black hole. Does the matter enter inside the event horizon or does it stay outside of the event horizon of the newborn black hole? IF the matter stays outside event horizon at the birth of BH, then it may be possible that all of the mass of BH is outside event horizon and the black hole is hollow inside in this sense.</p>

<p>On the other hand I am not sure about this, but the quantum tunneling effect and Heisenberg uncertainty principle may make possible that some of the particles can enter inside the event horizon.</p>

<p>So the question is, how the mass is distributed in ideal Schwarzchild Black hole in the viewpoint of distant observer?</p>

<p>There it is stated in one of the answers that a system is gapped if it fulfills the following gap-property:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is the definition of the ""gap property"": There is a fixed $\Delta$ (ie independent of $L_i$) such that the size-$L_i$ Hamiltonian has no eigenvalue in an energy window of size $\Delta$. The number of eigenstates below the energy window does not depend on $L_i$, the energy splitting of those eigenstates below the energy window approaches zero as $L_i\to\infty$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was wondering what happens for a Hamiltonian which has an <em>exact</em> ground state degeneracy (i.e. the ground states are exactly degenerate, also for finite $L_i$), which is however dependent on the system size (e.g. the degeneracy is exponential in $L_i$), but the gap <em>above</em> this ground space is finite? Why would one <em>not</em> say that this Hamiltonian is gapped? </p>

<p>A simple example for such a situation is the following (even classical) Hamiltonian:</p>

<p>$H=\sum_i Z_i Z_{i+1} - 2\sum_i Z_i$</p>

<p>where $Z$ is a Pauli-matrix. The ground states are all states you can generate from the all-up product-state by flipping single spins, such that no two neighboring spins are down-spins. The states with the most flipped spins you can generate that way are the two Néel states. The degeneracy of the ground space thus grows like the Fibonacci-sequence with the system size. The gap above that ground space is always $\Delta=4$.</p>

"269034","Dipole interaction for a two-level system in a trap potential","<p>Consider a two-level system under the following Hamiltonian:</p>

<p>$H=H_{I}+H_{E}+H_{dip}$</p>

<p>where $H_I$ is the Hamiltonian for the two internal states of the two-level system $span \{\left |e \right&gt; {,} \left |g \right&gt; \}$ (e $\rightarrow $ excited state, g $\rightarrow $ ground state), $H_E$ is the trap potential which could be quite general (in fact it could depend also on the internal degrees of freedom, e.g. a potential with different coupling for both states) and $H_{dip}$ is the dipole interaction between a laser and the <em>two-level system</em>, where the laser is treated classically. The trap potential induces a splitting in the energy levels associated within each manifold $\left |e \right&gt;$ and $\left |g \right&gt;$. Thus a possible basis would be $span\{\left |e {,} n_e \right&gt; {,} \left |g {,} n_g\right&gt;\}$ (note that $\left | n_e \right &gt;$ and $\left | n_g \right &gt;$ need not be equal), being this basis the eigenvectors of $H_{E}$ and $H_{I}$. The following paper <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.46.2668"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.46.2668</a> proposes what $H_{dip}$ should be for an harmonic trap and running-wave laser; mainly:</p>

<p>$V_{dip}=\frac{\Omega_0}{2} (e^{ik_L\hat{Z}} \left |e \right&gt;\left &lt;g \right|+e^{-ik_L\hat{Z}} \left |g \right&gt;\left &lt;e \right|)$</p>

<p>where $\Omega_0$ and $k_L$ are the Rabi frequency and the laser wavenumber respectively. Similar treatments of what $V_{dip}$ is are found in other references, i.e. they consider the dipole interaction as connecting only internal states. However this is true, I guess (I haven't seen a clear proof of this anywhere), in the case where the trap potential felt by both $\left |e \right&gt;$ and $\left |g \right&gt;$ is the same. My question then, is this also true generally for any trap potential? In other words, why won't light couple say different $n_g$ states within the ground state? What would be a quantum mechanical expression for the dipole moment operator in this case?</p>

"269037","A question about the Ward-Takahashi identity","<p>I am studying Peskin and Schroeder's textbook of <em>quantum field theory</em>. </p>

<p>I have proceeded to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%E2%80%93Takahashi_identity"" rel=""nofollow"">Ward-Takahashi identity</a> and have one question.</p>

<p>Eq.(7.66) and Eq.(7.67) are the two cases involved. Then the textbook proceeds to discuss the Ward-Takahashi identity by summing all possibilities for different Feynman diagrams (with external photon line striped) as well as different ways of inserting photons, where $M^{\mu}$ is the correlation function for $n$ inserting electrons and $n$ out-going electrons.
$$k_{\mu}M^{\mu}(k;p_1...p_n;q_1...q_n)=-e\sum_i[M_0(k;p_1...p_n;q_1...(q_i-k)...q_n)-M_0(k;p_1...(p_i+k)...p_n;q_1...q_n)].$$</p>

<p>It is understood that if ($M^{\mu}$) has all its external electrons on-shell, then the amplitudes on the right-hand side of this identity each have only one external particle off-shell, and therefore they do not contribute to S-matrix elements. As a result, the corresponding S matrix is zero if all the external electrons in the left hand side are on shell.</p>

<p>I understood that the discussions related to Eq.(7.66) only involve the singularity factor due to the on-shell external electron lines, and therefore applies to any individual Feynman diagram which possesses such external electron line structure (while enumerating all different ways of inserting the additional photon line). On the other hand, Eq.(7.67) gives zero by itself.</p>

<p>However, the textbook mentioned on P.238: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The identity is generally not true for individual Feynman diagrams; we must sum over the diagrams for $M(k)$ at any given order.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is (1) Why one still need the summation of all possible Feynman diagrams. It seems individual Feynman diagram with all possible ways of insertion of photon lines do the trick. (2) P.242 in the first plot, the incoming and outgoing Fermi lines are paired ($p_i$ to $q_i$). Why one does not consider the case when $p_i$ is paired to $q_j$ ($i\ne j$), it seems to me that this also contributes to the same physical process. Many thanks for the answer or comment!</p>

<p>PS: This question is a follow-up of <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61561/some-questions-about-ward-takahashi-identity"">a question</a> by <em>Brioschi</em>.</p>

"269039","What variables affect a Heat engine's efficiency? (and more)","<p>I'm writing a Minecraft mod and I'm trying to create the equations for the engines players can build. I'm a highschool sophomore, so my knowledge of physics and mathematics is limited. I asked first a question on the Chemistry site of stackexchange about how do we get the energy output of combustion engine. The answer was</p>

<p>$E = \kappa \Delta H°_{comb}V$</p>

<p>where $\kappa$ is the engine's efficiency,</p>

<p>$\Delta H°_{comb}$ is the enthalpy of combustion of the fuel</p>

<p>$V$ is the volume of fuel burned.</p>

<p>$\kappa$ was limited by several factors such as</p>

<ol>
<li>Compression Ratio (internal combustion only)</li>
<li>Gear Ratio (for high torque applications)</li>
<li>Working Fluid (external combustion only)</li>
<li>Ambient Temperature (mainly external combustion only)</li>
<li>Heat Exchanger Material (external combustion only)</li>
</ol>

<p>From there I continued researching on my own. I found there is an upper limit for $\kappa$ that is known as <em>Chambadal-Novikov efficiency</em> which is</p>

<p>$\eta = 1 - \sqrt\frac{T_L}{T_H}$</p>

<p>I also learned that heat engines that are used to produce electricity can have <em>combined cycles</em>: The principle is that after completing its cycle (in the first engine), the working fluid of the first heat engine is still low enough in its entropy that a second subsequent heat engine may extract energy from the waste heat (energy) of the working fluid of the first engine.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>How can I define variables 2 to 5 and how can I approximate how much of $\kappa$ each of them account for?</p>

<p>How arbitrary can the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs in the <em>Chambadal-Novikov efficiency</em> equation be? I assume the cold reservoir is the environment, but what dictates $T_H$'s upper limit?</p>

<p>Considering a steam engine with combined cycles, how high must the temperature of the steam be as it exits the first engine to make it useful for a second engine?</p>

<p>Further to this,</p>

"269052","Wouldn't any structured beam of light be expected to travel slower than a plane wave?","<p>There aren't many new, actual bona-fide discoveries in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics#Classical_optics"">classical optics</a> these days. </p>

<p>I saw this news item in Phys.org: <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2016-03-optical-slower.html"">Observation of twisted optical beam traveling slower than the speed of light</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The researchers first noticed the slow speed of twisted light when conducting experiments with Gaussian laser light and light with 10 twists. ""We realized that the two beams didn't arrive at the detector at the same time,"" Karimi said. ""The twisted light was slower, which was surprising until we realized that the twists make the beam tilt slightly as it propagates. This tilt means that the twisted light beam doesn't take the straightest, and thus fastest, path between two points.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In waveguides, for example few-mode optical fibers with very small index differences, each mode propagates at a different velocity. The differences can be big - a few percent. Roughly speaking, the more complex the mode looks, the more transverse k, the less longitudinal k.</p>

<p>The same is true with defined beams in free space. As soon as you start adding spatial structure, by focusing a wide beam to a narrow beam, or making more complex shaped beams, anything where you have more transverse k vector, the beam slows down, and it is 100% consistent and calculable from Maxwell's equations.</p>

<p>It may be quite difficult to verify for experimental reasons, I can understand that, and it's always good to verify something that hasn't been verified before for many reasons - student research experience, putting the expensive equipment to the test, increment publication list, etc. It's good.</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> Is it something that is absolutely expected to happen - any structured beam in space will be slower than an infinite plane wave in space? <em>Wouldn't any structured beam of light be expected to travel slower than a plane wave?</em></p>

<p>The Phys.org article links to the paper <a href=""https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-3-4-351"">Observation of subluminal twisted light in vacuum</a> Frédéric Bouchard, Jérémie Harris, Harjaspreet Mand, Robert W. Boyd, and Ebrahim Karimi Optica Vol. 3, Issue 4, pp. 351-354 (2016)</p>

<p><em>Subluminal</em> means slower than the speed of <em>plane wave</em> light (in the same medium), and my point is that <em>any finite beam of light</em> will <em>always be subluminal</em> -  travel slower than <em>a plane wave</em> in the medium. </p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I just noticed this at the bottom. ""...<em>their calculations have predicted may travel around 1 femtosecond faster than the speed of light in a vacuum</em>"" so apparently they don't think so!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it's possible to slow the speed of light by altering its structure, it may also be possible to speed up light. The researchers are now planning to use FROG to measure other types of structured light that their calculations have predicted may travel around 1 femtosecond faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>

<p>However we have derived that
 $U = (f/2)nRT$ from only the $KE$ in the equipartion theorem ignoring all other types of energies? </p>

<p>Even if we have an ideal gas, there should still be some nuclear binding energy?</p>

<p>Or from this.. we know that for all proceses 
$\mathrm{d}U = nC_v\mathrm{d}T$
integrating both sides from $0$ to $T$, we should get $$U(\text{at }T) - U(\text{at } 0K) = nC_v(T-0)$$
So at a particular $T$ $$U(T) = nC_vT + U(0) \quad[C_v = fR/2]$$
This gives $$U = (f/2)nRT + U(0)$$ This $U(\text{at }0 K)$ should include all those types of energies which are not taken in account of motion like all that bond energy, nuclear binding energy.</p>

"269059","Can superfluids pass through ordinary baryonic matter?","<p>Since superfluids consists of integer spin bosons or effective bosonic Cooper-paired fermions, Pauli Exclusion Principle does not apply to them. They can thus occupy the same quantum state as any other normal baryonic matter, effectively going through them if electromagnetic repulsion between them is low enough to not oppose its motion. </p>

<p>Basically, if a superfluid and a slab of cold baryonic matter meets, will the superfluid go through the baryonic matter unaffected with little interaction? (Assuming it has enough velocity to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion i.e. $KE \space&gt; EPE$)</p>

<p>For example He-4 is bosonic as it has an integer spin 0, if we cool it down to superfluid temperature and put it in a container made of baryonic matter (i.e. glass/silicon dioxide) it will pass through the container? (Since it can occupy same quantum states as the particles in the container.)</p>

<p>Rather creepy theory, don't you think?</p>

<p>P.S. : Quantum state includes spatial coordinates of the wave function of the particle and spin and other things, so Pauli Exclusion forbids fermions to occupy the same space unless their spin is opposite. This does not apply to spin 0 particles (bosons) so they can all occupy the same space if there was no repulsion between them. So spin 0 particles can pass freely through fermions and other particles if the EM repulsion between them is overcome either due to it being weak or the condensates having high velocity?</p>

<p>However, there will be electromagnetic repulsion between the bosons which will not enable it to crowd and thus they seemingly cannot all achieve the same quantum state. This electromagnetic repulsion is a function of charge, not temperature, so I don't see why cooling it to near $ 0~\mathrm{K} $ will help many bosons get to the same quantum state. The material should behave the same at any temperature, with only classical state changes and density decreasing as temperature decreases due to lower $V_{rms}$ of the particles.</p>

<p>If this is what happens then how does Bose-Einstein Condensates and superfluids form? Don't they form as a result of crowding of bosons into one single quantum state? How can this be achieved with EM repulsion forcing these bosons apart?</p>

"269088","Time to reach steady state in transient 1-D heat conduction","<p>Suppose that there is a slab with thickness $2L$ and other dimensions of the slab are very bigger than $L$. Both sides of the slab are kept in the constant temperature $T_0$. In time $t=0$ a heat source starts to generate heat uniformly with constant $q$.</p>

<p>Now, when we solve this mathematically and use , for example Fourier series, the time needed to reach steady state is infinite. But physically, it doesn't make any sense! One intuition for this is that with infinite time to reach steady state, generated heat, $qA_s L$, is infinite!</p>

"269090","Significance of electrical fields of infinite objects","<p>I've noticed a pattern with the electric fields of charged objects of infinite dimensions.</p>

<p>A point charge, which can be considered a charge of 0 dimensions, has an electric field that goes as $r^{-2}$. An infinite line of charge, a 1 dimensional object, has an electric field that goes as $r^{-1}$. The infinite plane (2D) has a constant electric field, or a field proportional to $r^0$. And if one considers a sphere of electrical charge, you can make a Gaussian sphere inside it, and this electric field should grow as $r^1$.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out an explanation for this pattern. The original question that led me to consider this was the difference between the infinite line and the infinite plane: why does one depend on r but not the other? It's addressed briefly in Griffiths E&amp;M, where I believe he says something along the lines of ""you can't get away from an infinite plane"". But by that reasoning, I don't understand how you can ""get away"" from an infinite line, either. The reasoning make some sense if you consider an infinite plank, a plane that is infinite in one dimension and finite in another, so that as you get further away, one dimension ""shrinks"" while the other continues to ""appear the same"". However, the ""perfect"" infinite line should only have one dimension to begin with, so it should ""appear the same"" no matter how far away or close you are...</p>

<p>I suppose my questions are these: why does this pattern between the dimensions of an object and its field exist? How do you ""get away"" from an infinite line?</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WXtON.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WXtON.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then the system of equations should be</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray}
m_1g &amp; = &amp; m_1g-k(z_1-L)-k(z_1-z_2+L) \\
m_2g &amp; = &amp; m_2g-k(z_2-z_1-L)
\end{eqnarray}</p>

<p>where $L$ is the natural length of the two springs. My solution was identical with the solution given, however, there was one small difference - I wrote the gravitational force in the first equation as $(m_1+m_2)g$ rather than simply $m_1g$. </p>

<p>Is there an error in my reasoning? The gravitational force on the first mass should involve the sum of the two masses...</p>

"269093","How do we know singularities/black holes actually bend time?","<p>Recently I read up on some articles about singularities / black holes, how they form and how they affect their surroundings.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I am no physicist and I found those articles on the internet, so this might be completely wrong.</p>

<p>Anyways, it is stated that when a star collapses into a singularity, the process takes a couple of milliseconds at the most. BUT for an external observer the collapse would take much longer due to the fact that singularities bend the space-time-continuum around them and actually slow down time.</p>

<p>This got me thinking. Black holes get their name from the fact that their gravity is so high that photons can't escape from it. So during the collapse of the star the offgoing photons would be heavily slowed down. For an observer this would infact look as if time slowed down, because the photons would reach the observer's eye in ever increasing time intervals, right?
So, how do we actually know that time is slowed down and it is not just an optical illusion?</p>

<p>I hope you are able to follow my thought process, otherwise I'll gladly elaborate.</p>

<p>Thanks for all answers in advance! :)</p>

"269100","Does a Polarizing Beam Splitter Cause Wave Function Collapse?","<p>For a single photon, its polarization can be a superposition of two orthogonal bases (e.g. horizontal or vertical). However, as I understand, once it has been measured, it must collapse into one of the possible bases. So does that mean that once a photon hits a polarizing beam splitter its wave function collapses? After all, there are only two options: either the photon goes through or it does not. Assuming the original polarization was 45 degrees the, the probability for both events is 50%. Or, if we do not measure which path it takes, does it simply exist in a superposition of the two possible paths, meaning that we have not affected the wave function.</p>

<p>Secondly, I am a bit confused by the idea that once we make a measurement the photon must collapse into one of the possible base states. For example, if we measure that the photon was reflected by the beam splitter, we might conclude that it is either horizontally or vertically polarized (depending on the configuration of the beam splitter) but it could very well be simply 45 degrees of polarization. </p>

The energy from the heat causes the electrons in the body to oscillate, so they will emit electromagnetic waves.

Here are my questions assuming the above description is correct:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it true that there are equal number of electrons emitting each frequency or there are less electrons emitting higher frequencies?</p></li>
<li><p>Is intensity of radiation related to a wave's amplitude? or is it related to number of electrons emitting a certain frequency?</p></li>

"269142","Riemann Invariants","<p>I understand that the Riemann Invariants for an expansion wave (isentropic) are constant along the particular characteristic line i.e.:</p>

<p>$u + \frac{2c}{\gamma-1} = const $ along $dx/dt=u+a$ (1)</p>

<p>Entropy $s = const$ along $dx/dt=u$ (2)</p>

<p>$u - \frac{2c}{\gamma-1} = const $ along $dx/dt=u-a$ (3)</p>

<p>This is determined by multiplying the inverse right Eigenvector matrix with the primitive state vector $[ d\rho, du, dP ]^T$ and then integrating the resulting equation</p>

<p>Another method some authors use is to divide the primitive state vector by the respective Eigenvector components for each wave. E.g. for the left running wave:</p>

<p>$\frac{d\rho}{K_1} = \frac{du}{K_2} = \frac{dP}{K_3}$ (4)</p>

<p>Where $K_i$ are the components of the Eigenvector that corresponds to the respective Eigenvalue (wave speed $\lambda = dx/dt$). Thus, for the left running wave (dx/dt = u-a), we get the Riemann invariants (1) and (2) from (4).</p>

<p>Thus, these two invariants correspond to the characteristic (3), i.e. they are constant along this characteristic.</p>

<p>I am now confused by the statements (1) (2) and (3), which state that each invariant is constant along that respective characteristic line Vs. the invariants (1) and (2) correspond to the wave characteristic (3).</p>

<p>Does this then imply that all invariants are constant along all three of those characteristic lines? How does one obtain the equation (4), I could not find this anywhere?</p>

"269159","Defining center of mass in the presence of curvature","<p>The definition of center of mass in most text books will look something like $\frac{\sum m_k r_k}{\sum m_k}$ or in the continuous case, $\frac{1}{\int \rho(r) dr}\int \rho(r) r dr$. However, this definition depends critically on some unspoken assumptions. At the very least, it seems that you must be working in a <a href=""http://planetmath.org/riemannnormalcoordinates"" rel=""nofollow"">normal coordinate chart</a>. </p>

<p>For instance, the above definitions fail badly if we decide to work in polar coordinates: If $(R, \theta_k)$ are the polar coordinates of $n$ points spaced evenly around a circle, we should expect their center of mass to be at $(0, 0)$. However, with the definitions, we get that the center of mass will be at some point with coordinates $(R, \theta^\prime)$ for some $\theta^\prime$ depending on the choice of chart.</p>

<p>So if we were to work in a curved space, be it a pseudo-Riemannian spacetime or a 2-dimensional spacial surface (thought of as position in 3D space with some constraint imposed upon it), how would we generalize the usual definition of the center of mass to work in the presence of curvature?</p>

<p>So I've used two different approaches to solve this problem and none of them are correct for reasons unknown to me. The first approach was to find the x and y components of both velocities, then using those find the average x and y velocities, and finally using Pythagoras theorem to find the average velocity using average x and y velocity components. This yields 43.56 which is incorrect. Please note that the expression I used for the average velocity of this kind of motion (one velocity for one half of the path, and another for the 2nd half) is $$\frac{2v_1v_2}{v_1+v_2}$$ (I used this to find average x and y velocity components). Although this approach was intuitive to me I think it is wrong because I don't think that just finding the average velocity components and then using them to find the average velocity is the way to go. I tried simply applying the definition equation of average velocity ($\frac{displacement}{time~interval}$) and then it boils down to simply plugging the velocities in the above written equation and it then the average velocity is 48 km/h. But this is incorrect as well. The correct value of the average velocity is 46.36 km/h. Any clarification would be welcome.</p>

<p>The beat frequency heard is $6Hz$ so the new frequency (the one in the string with the lower tension) is $$f_2 = 125-6 = 119Hz$$.  Therefore the new period is $T_2=  1/119Hz = 8.4 ms$.</p>

<p>Now I've tried to solve the second part but i couldn't.</p>

<p>My difficulty is that I can't calculate the tension because in order to do that I should have more information about the string which I don't.</p>

<p>Is my reasoning right?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: The formula that relates frequency to tension, mass and length for each string is
$$f_1 =\frac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T_1}{\frac{m}{L}}}$$
and 
$$f_2 =\frac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T_2}{\frac{m}{L}}}$$ where $T_2 = T_1 - 7$</p>

<p>$$\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \sqrt{\frac{T_1}{T_2}}$$
$$\frac{f_1^2}{f_2^2} = \frac{T_1}{T_2} $$
$$(f_1^2 - f_2^2)*T_1 = f_1^2 * (7) $$
And finally 
$$ T_1 = \frac{7f_1^2}{f_1^2 - f_2^2} \approx 74.7 N $$</p>

<p>Is this right?</p>

"269229","$SU(3)$ global gauge group","<p>Referring to the quantum observables of quarks, is it true that the color $SU(3)$ unitary representation commutes with all observables? </p>

<p>I am not referring here to the <em>local</em> $SU(3)$ gauge theory, I am just considering the <em>global</em> color $SU(3)$ symmetry.  </p>

<p>My problem is that, if it were the case, it would not possible to distinguish a pair of apparently different (pure) states represented by unit vectors $\Psi$, $\Psi'$ if $\Psi' = U\Psi$ when  $U$ is such a gauge transformation, by means of any sort of measurement. Indeed if $A$ is an observable $$\langle \Psi'|A \Psi' \rangle = \langle U\Psi|A U\Psi \rangle =  \langle \Psi|U^*A U\Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi|A U^*U\Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi|A \Psi \rangle\:.$$    In other words $U$ plays the exact role of phases in QM  when the algebra of observables is the whole class of selfadjoint operators. In this respect, states should be re-defined as equivalence classes $[\Psi]$ with respect to the equivalence under the action of color $SU(3)$.</p>

<p>Conversely, I have read that the color degrees of freedom have been introduced (also) to fix problems with the spin statistic principle. </p>

<p>There are  states $\Psi$ of hadrons composed of three quarks which seem to be symmetric under swap of particles in spite of the fact that quarks are fermions.   Adding an antisymmetric color part $\Phi_{color}$ to the state, the complete state  $\Psi \otimes  \Phi_{color}$ satisfies the spin statistic principle. Here the color $SU(3)$ representation just acts on the part $\Phi_{color}$ of the state.</p>

<p>Assuming I have understood well, I am not sure to agree with this idea because as the part $\Phi_{color}$ is <em>a priori</em> unobservable it cannot play any physical role and it cannot be used to fix problems with Pauli principle.</p>

<p>In Michelson and Morley experiment, Michelson calculated that the total time traveled by light with respect to the stationary observer standing at ether field was $2L/c$. </p>

<p>Here, Michelson followed the Galilean Theory of relativity, i.e., since light was travelling not a vertical path but a longer hypotenuse path of a right triangle as seen by the stationary observer at the ether field, the relative speed of light with respect to the observer is $\sqrt{c^2+u^2}$, $u$ being the speed of whole apparatus assumed to be moving with respect to the observer on the ether field.</p>

<p>But, Alfred Potier and Lorentz corrected that light as seen by the observer should not be moving at $\sqrt{c^2+u^2}$ but at ""$c$"".
My question is that how did Lorentz and Alfred know that light will be moving at ""$c$"" with respect to the Observer at the ether field when light is traveling perpendicular to the motion of the apparatus.</p>

<p>For the case where you add a positive charge, the electrons would move so as to cancel the effective electric field of the added charge, and electrostatic equilibrium would be obtained.

"269251","Proof of Exponential Decay Behavior of Time Correlation Functions","<p>For a given protein, I know that the NMR Spectroscopy magnet generates a field $\mathrm{B_o}$ and that the interactions with the spins in the local environment generates a much smaller field $\mathrm{B_{loc}}$ (not necessary aligned with $\mathrm{B_o}$.<br>
Owing to Brownian collisions between solvent molecules and the protein, the atoms associated with these spins move, hence making $\mathrm{B_{loc}}$ a function of time ($\mathrm{B_o}$ is constant).
We define a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_function_%28statistical_mechanics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">time correlation function</a>$$\mathrm{G(t,\tau}) = \overline{\mathrm{B_{loc}(t)B_{loc}(t+\tau)}},$$ where $\mathrm{G(t,\tau})$ is a stationary random function (see Time evolution of correlation functions (specifically Onsager's hypothesis) in time correlation link)<br>
Hence $\mathrm{G(t,\tau})$ only depends on $\tau$, the delay in measuring $\mathrm{B_{loc}}$.<br>
So, for simplicity we set $t = 0$ and note that $$\mathrm{G(t,\tau)} = \overline{\mathrm{B_{loc}(0)}^2} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\tau}{\mathrm{\tau_c}}},$$ where $\mathrm{\tau_c}$ is the correlation time, the time it takes for the whole molecule to rotate by 1 radian in a process called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_diffusion"" rel=""nofollow"">rotational diffusion</a>.<br>

<p>So if it is that the interactions with photons from lasers, or the fields of magnetic detectors, make the buckyball molecule behave differently. Why is it then that the forces holding the molecule together (I guess the electron sharing or covalent bonds?), and the forces holding the atoms together (I'm guessing electromagnetic forces between the electrons and nuclei, and nuclear forces within the nuclei?) are insufficient to cause decoherence? Wouldn't this suggest that it is not merely these interactions/forces that cause the perturbance which causes decoherence? Are there any forces or interactions within the molecule that <em>could</em> cause decoherence?</p>

"269269","Problem with figuring out sign conventions in QFT","<p>I have a problem with sign conventions in QFT which I have trouble dealing with myself. I self-study and mainly use Weinberg and Peskin. I will present the reasoning following conventions adapted by Peskin and say where I think it runs into difficulties.</p>

<p>Metric signature which I use is $+---$. We adapt the convention that translations are implemented in Hilbert space according to formula
$$ U(1,a) = e ^{-iP \cdot a}, $$
in particular time translations are implemented by $e^{-itH}$. Weinberg uses the opposite convention, but I am reluctant to accept it as it is inconsistent with Schrodinger equation and standard quantum mechanics. This decision implies that creation operators for Klein-Gordon field satisfy
$$ U( \Lambda, a) a_p ^{\dagger} U(\Lambda , a ) ^{\dagger} = e^{-i \Lambda p \cdot a} a_{\Lambda p} ^{\dagger}. $$
Negative frequency part of the field is defined as
$$ \phi^ - (x) = \int \mathrm d \mu (p) a_p ^{\dagger} e ^{ipx}, $$
while $\phi ^ +(x) = \phi ^- (x) ^{\dagger}$, Lorentz invariant measure is given by $\mathrm d \mu (p) =  \frac{\mathrm d ^3 \vec p}{(2 \pi)^3 2E}$ and Lorentz invairant commutation relations are $[a_p,a_{p'}^{\dagger}]= (2 \pi) ^3 2E \delta ^3 (\vec p - \vec p')$. But using previous relation we get transformation rule for fields
$$ U(\Lambda, a) \phi ^- (x) U(\Lambda, a)^{\dagger} = \phi ^- (\Lambda x -a).$$
This relation seems just wrong - I think we should get something like $\phi ^- (\Lambda x +a )$. It seems like $U(\Lambda, a )$ really implements the transformation $(\Lambda, -a)$ in contrary to what was anticipated. This can be remedied by redefining fields to have $e^{-ipx}$ next to creation operator and $e^{ipx}$ next to annihilation operator. But it seems noone does it. It has obvious drawback that when one does it we don't get canonical commutation relations, but instead their negative ($[\phi, \pi] = - i \delta$). It seems that Weinberg avoids these problems by declaring that translations are implemented by the operators $e^{iPa }$ (which is $e^{-iPa}$ with his choice of signature), but I think it's unacceptable. Is it at all possible to avoid these problem without destroyng either CCR or Shrodinger equation?</p>

<p>Remark: I am aware that Schrodinger equation is not a thing in QFT, I only mean that time translation operator is $e^{-itH}$.</p>

<p>showing (above) the anticrossing opening up between electron and hole branches in the superconducting phase and (below) the Bogoliubov amplitudes, giving the amount of hole like or electron like character of the quasiparticle. So it seems to me that quasiparticles at the band edge (energy of $\Delta$) must always be neutral, as they are equal parts hole and electron. But this does not sit very well with my picture of a Cooper pair being broken into two quasiparticles by a photon of energy $2\Delta$. Such a photon would (or could) create two quasiparticles at the band edge, which therefore have total charge zero, starting from a Cooper pair of charge $2e$. What's gone wrong here?</p>

<p>I also have trouble reconciling this with my understanding of superconducting single electron transistors (SSETs). Here's a figure from <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n9/full/nphys1339.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a>, showing gapped Coulomb diamonds in an SSET;</p>

<p>There's a lot going on here, but the relevant thing for this question is that quasiparticles are being injected at the band edge, where (again) they should have zero charge, but they are still capable of contributing to the conductance. Something is very wrong with one (or both!) of my understandings.</p>

<p>Black phosphorous is flaky and planar (sort of like a bunch of connected trigonal planar molecules) and so this seems right to me.</p>

<p>Black phosphorous is electrically conductive. Is black phosphorous electrically conductive because the phosphorous atoms are relatively close to each other and because there is a free lone electron pair that can be easily ionized off and then swapped around the phosphorous atoms?</p>

<p>Are all covalent crystal compounds with lone electron pairs (or I guess lone electrons work too) electrically conductive? Can one engineer compounds with a great deal of lone electron pairs? I would think that period 4 and above elements which could have a bunch of d orbital lone electron pair should be electrically conductive but I have read that s and p orbitals are taken off first in chemical reactions and so should be taken off before electrically too.</p>

<p>I think this has 2 answers:</p>

<p>1) Using maths - but it will be mostly impossible</p>

<p>2) There will be a theoretical proof (this is what I am interested into)</p>

<p>I could think of the ''theoretical'' proof - Check it whether its right:</p>

<p>Inside an arbitrarily shaped container we can imagine an imaginary cube shaped container (with imaginary boundaries, of course!)
and I think that the existence of those imaginary boundaries can be justified owing to the large number of intermolecular collisions, in sense -the place where we have assumed the imaginary boundaries of the cube-shaped container, right there the randomly moving molecules are colliding so fast and so much that, resultantly we can assume a wall existing right there.</p>

<p>And hence again do the same cubical container proof.</p>

<p>So is this right?</p>

<p>Now if this were really the case and we measure the time between the emission of a photon and its impact on the photoscreen, doesn't this mean that some photons would actually travel with a velocity far greater than the speed of light?

"269362","Bulbs glow with different brightness in one arrangement and the same brightness in the other arrangement","<p>The question is:
Mr.X decorated his house with fairy lights on a celebration.He bought 40 bulbs and operated at 220V. He found all the bulbs are glowing with different brightness. He called his friend Mr.Y. He rearranged and made the bulbs glow equally.
a)What was the problem with Mr.X's set up?Give reason.
b)How did Mr.Y arrange the bulbs.</p>

<p>The following is my understanding (The time is same in all cases and subcases):</p>

<p>Firstly, the brightness of a bulb depends upon the energy consumed by it. 
There are two cases:When the resistance is same in all the bulbs and when the resistance is different for different bulbs.</p>

<p>Case 1:Resistance is same in all bulbs.
Subcase 1:The bulbs are connected in parallel.
 $H=\frac{v^2}{R}*t$.
Since the resistance and the voltage both remain same, energy consumed by every bulb is same and hence they all glow with equal brightness.
Subcase 2:The bulbs are connected in series.
$H=I^2Rt$.
Since the resistance and the current through it remain same, in this case also, the energy consumed must be the same.
Hence the situation given in the problem will not arise if all the bulbs have the same resistance.</p>

<p>Case 2:When the bulbs have different resistances.
Subcase 1:If the bulbs are connected in parallel.
$V=IR$.
The voltage is same for all the bulbs. The resistances are different. Hence, the current will be divided among the bulbs with respect to their resistance. Since each bulb has different resistance, it glows with different brightness. If current passes through it according to each bulb's requirement,then the bulbs will glow by using their maximum power and will glow with different brightness.
Subcase 2:The bulbs are connected in series.
$H=I^2Rt$
The current through each bulb is the same. The resistances are different. Hence, the energy consumed by each bulb is different.</p>

<p>My understanding makes me conclude that the question is wrong. I am utterly confused about this problem. A book's solution indicates that we should only check for potential difference.Can anyone please tell me the mistakes in my understanding,if any, and provide me with a proper solution to the problem?Any help is appreciated.</p>

"269403","Which temperature does $T$ in Clausius inequality ($\oint \frac{\delta Q}T\le 0$) refer to?","<p>I got a little confused about the temperature in Clausius inequality. As you can see in <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/66908/having-a-problem-about-entropy-thermodynamics/66911#66911"">this answer</a> of Luboš Motl, it seems that temperature is <strong>the temperature of the system</strong>.</p>

<p>But in some answers of Chester Miller e.g. <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/254456/clausius-inequality-with-three-reservoirs/254471#254471"">this</a> and <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/253064/increase-in-entropy-principle/253085#253085"">this</a>, he has apparently mentioned that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$T$ is the temperature at the <strong>boundary interface</strong> (with the surroundings) at which heat transfer is occurring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think $T$ in $\oint \frac{\delta Q}T\le 0$ is the temperature of the system, because $\mathrm dS=\frac{\delta Q_{\textrm{rev}}}T$, and $S$ is a property of the system. So, it should be related to a property of <strong>whole</strong> of system not a property of system boundary.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Clausius inequality is valid for all cases either reversible or irreversible. And for some irreversible (e.g. non-quasi-static) processes, we cannot define a temperature for system.</p>

<p>May someone please explain clearly what is the temperature in Clausius inequality?</p>

"269416","Completeness relation for coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator","<p>For the Quantum harmonic oscillator with energy eigenstates $|n\rangle$ one defines a coherent state for every complex number $z$ by setting (note that the normalization varies across the literature)
$$\psi_z:=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{\sqrt{n!}}|n\rangle.$$
In the book ""Quantum Theory - a mathematical approach"" by Peter Bongaarts he claims the following result without proof (I slightly changed the notation):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any vector $\phi$ in the Hilbert space (of the oscillator) can be expressed as
  $$\phi=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{z\in\mathbb{C}}F_{\phi}(z)e^{-|z|^2}\psi_z\qquad \tag{1}$$
  where the function $F_\phi$ is <strong>uniquely</strong> determined by
  $$F_\phi(z)=\langle \psi_z, \phi \rangle.$$ 
  This function is anti-holomorphic and satisfies
  $$\int_{z\in\mathbb{C}}|F_{\phi}(z)|^2 e^{-|z|^2}&lt;\infty.$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically what I'm trying to do is to prove this claim. It is rather easy to see (ignoring questions like ""what do I need to know about Bochner Integrals to change order with infinite sums""), that taking the specified function $F_\phi$ one does get equality (1) and also to show that it is anti-holomorphic. </p>

<p>However, I do not believe that the function is necessarily unique among ALL measurable functions $\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$. Best case scenario would be that two such functions differ on a set of measure zero, but even that seems unlikely. I suspect the function is unique among the anti-holomorphic functions. Does anyone know the correct claim for this and the proof or where to find it? The next thing I'm struggling with is to show that the last integral is bounded.</p>

"269423","Entanglement of bi- and tripartite pure and mixed states","<p>since I'm not sure on how to find out whether a system is entangled or not I thought about examples that could clarify the whole thing.</p>

<p>first example: system is in the state $\rho=1/2 (| 000 \rangle \langle 000| + |001 \rangle \langle001|)$<br>
The first thing to do is to find out whether it is a pure or mixed state. Since $\rho^2=\rho$ it is a pure state.</p>

<p>Now, I can write the state as $\rho=|00\rangle \langle00| \bigotimes 1/2 \left(|0\rangle\langle0| + |1\rangle\langle1|\right)=|0\rangle\langle0|_A\bigotimes |0\rangle\langle0|_B\bigotimes 1/2 \left(|0\rangle\langle0|+|1\rangle\langle 1|\right)_C$.</p>

<p>If I take the partial trace now over A and B, then</p>

<p>$\rho_c=Tr_{AB}[\rho_{ABC}]=1/2 (|0\rangle\langle0|+|1\rangle\langle|1)$) </p>

<p>is in a mixed state. This means that the bipartite System AB and C is entangled. But what happens if I only trace over System C?</p>

<p>Then $\rho_{AB}=|00\rangle\langle00|$. But that's a pure state. How is that possible? </p>

<p>If I'm not mistaken, AC is not entangled with B and BC is not entangled with A. Is this correct? </p>

<p>My second example: starting from the density matrix $\rho= 1/2(|\phi^+\rangle\langle \phi^+|+|\phi^-\rangle\langle\phi^-|)=1/2(|00\rangle\langle00|+|11\rangle\langle11|)$. </p>

<p>Now, the criterion ""$\text{A  and B are entangled} \Rightarrow \rho_A \text{ and } \rho_B$ are mixed"" cannot be applied, since $\rho_{AB}$ is not pure.</p>

<p>So, I just guessed and found that the whole state can be written as</p>

<p>$\rho=1/2(|0\rangle\langle0|+|1\rangle\langle1|) \bigotimes (|0\rangle\langle0|+|1\rangle\langle1|)+ 1/2(|0\rangle\langle0| -|1\rangle\langle1|) \bigotimes (0|\rangle\langle0|- |1\rangle\langle1|)$. </p>

<p>This means, that this state is separable as well. Correct?</p>

<p>I can't really think of an example for a mixed entangled state. Does anyone know an example and explain me how I can see that this is a mixed entangled state?</p>

<p>At first I interpret this (the commutator part) as measuring how different the tensor would be after being parallel transported along two different paths ($\mu$ to $\nu$ vs $\nu$ to $\mu$) and this is the diagram he has in the book. However, he also says (on page 122) ""the covariant derivative of a tensor in a certain direction measures how much the tensor changes relative to what it would have been if it were parallel transported."" This implies to me that we are moving the tensor through some means other than parallel transport. He also earlier says, ""the covariant derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of the tensor field in comparison to what the tensor would be if it were 'parallel transported.'""</p>

"269443","When Does Mass Matter?","<p>I have been trying to wrap my head around this idea for a month or so, and I am not really sure how mass plays into the velocity of a moving body.  I have not taken physics in a while, but one thing I remember clearly is my professor harping on mass does not matter.  But that does not make sense to me.  For example, if I apply a few Newtons of force to a pencil, I can easily slide it across a driveway, but if I apply the same force to a car it would not budge.  Another thing my professor said was, ""more mass hauls a**,"" i.e. a body in motion stays in motion, which I get because it takes more force to stop something with more mass.</p>

<p>So now here is where my question begins.  I have been trying to figure out how to calculate the force needed to get a specific final velocity accounting for both gravity and friction.  As per my example above with the pencil and the car, the results I am getting do not match what I was expecting.  One of the reasons I think this is happening is because I don't have the right equations.  I thought that this was an inertia problem, but I may be wrong, or maybe my conception of the physical world is wrong and I just can't get past my preconceived ideas about mass and motion.</p>

<p>Here is the scenario I am working with:  </p>

<ul>
<li>I am trying to push a 1000 kg car</li>
<li>The car is initially at rest</li>
<li>The coefficient of friction is .80</li>
</ul>

<p>If I want to car to move at 10 m/s, how hard to I need to push it?</p>

<p>After it is going 10 m/s, I want to push it again and make it go 20 m/s, how hard do I need to push it now to achieve that?</p>

<p>Now that I am not pushing it, how long will it take to slow down to 0 m/s?</p>

But nowhere has there been any consideration given to this important factor:</p>

<p>Let's assume a Plane is flying horizontally, cruising, with a speed of v. And the wings in our case are just strait rectangular thin blades of aluminum attached to fuselage in a fixed angle, called angle of attack.</p>

<p>This wing creates lift many ways but the two most important components of the lift are the lift created by the top face of the wing which is slanted acts like a slope that is constantly running from under the column of air on top of it and causing that column of air spending part of its huge 1 metric ton per square meter pressure to accelerate down and spill into the vacuum created by the forward sliding of its support, the wing top. </p>

<p>The vertical speed of this column of air $\ V(air- rushing- down)= V. sin(angle- of -attack).$</p>

<p>The work needed to accelerate the flow of vertical column if air downward, from zero to V.sin(a), draws from the pressure of the column of the air on top and creates less pressure on the top surface of the wing.
And I am thinking if this speed surpasses the critical speed of air we get turbulent flow and lose the lift, stall.
I wonder why this major factor is ignored?
Am I missing something here?  </p>

It would start in the breast milk container in the fridge, pass through a giant bowl of water at 40°C,  potentially spiraling several times inside it, and end 1-meter lower where I sit in the sofa. In essence, this would be a <a href=""http://www.calctool.org/CALC/eng/civil/hazen-williams_g"" rel=""nofollow"">gravity-fed pipe</a> for which initial calculations revealed a speed $v=0.39m/s$ and a discharge rate of $167mL/min$, if we crudely assume that breast milk has similar properties to water.</p>

<p>Not sure this was tried before, but it seems promising to me.
The flow-rate is sufficiently high to feed an infant in real-time. The only remaining question was whether the milk warms up fast enough to reach infant consumption temperature. Fortunately, if we plug the numbers in the answer given by Gert, then spiraling 1 meter through the water tank would already bring the milk to reasonable consumption temperature.</p>

"269518","Justification of Physical Laws","<p>I'm a maths student, and I've studied quite a lot of mathematical physics. All my courses have a similar style - we state the laws of the system, and then deduce the physical consequences as theorems. It has become more and more apparent to me (especially studying electromagnetism and QM) that I have no idea why you would expect these equations to be true. </p>

<p>What I'm looking for is either a kind of physical justification ""this is how object X behaves, here are mathematical statements that say this precisely"" (similar to momentum-based arguments in fluid dynamics), or some kind of experimental justification (the more direct the better), for physical laws. I'm particularly interested in this with respect to Maxwell's equations, but I'm interested in any others as well.</p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarification:</strong><br>
Perhaps I worded myself poorly. The axioms of a physical theory (which is what I meant by 'laws'), like any set of axioms, are invented by human beings with the aim of capturing certain intuitive properties of an object. For example, the axioms defining a vector space in mathematics are not completely arbitrary - they aim to capture the properties of various objects ($\mathbb{R}^{n}$, or function spaces for example) that we have an intuitive idea of. </p>

<p>I am asking the equivalent question with respect to physical theories, and especially in terms of Maxwell's equations, e.g.: what are the intuitive properties of charges and currents that lead one to write down Maxwell's equations? Note that the answer 'they match up with experiment' doesn't fit, because many theories could match the same observations and be mutually contradictory (e.g. Newton vs relativity at small velocities). There also is no condition on the <em>correctness</em> of the interpretation - any explanation of, say, Newtonian mechanics, would necessarily not be an absolutely correct picture of the world (or it would be the correct physical theory, too!).</p>

<p>Obviously such a justification would have to be empirical to have any grounding in reality. For instance if we want to know if Newton's second law is true, we can set up an experiment to check it. Less experimentally, most people take the existence of absolute time, or inertial frames of reference, to be intuitively obvious. Similarly, properties like acceleration and momentum have physical interpretations, and a good explanation could be given in terms of such quantities.</p>

"269538","Proving that the Boltzmann entropy is equal to the thermodynamic entropy","<p>I've been trying to understand how we can equate the Boltzmann entropy $k_B \ln \Omega$ and the entropy from thermodynamics. I'm following the approach found in the first chapter in Pathria's statistical mechanics, and in many other texts. Many other questions on stackexchange come close to addressing this problem, but I don't think any of the answers get at my specific question.</p>

<p>So, we're considering two isolated systems 1 and 2, which are brought into thermal contact and allowed to exchange energy (let's assume for simplicity that they can <em>only</em> exchange energy). On the thermodynamic side of the problem, we have the necessary and sufficient condition for thermal equilibrium</p>

<p>$$T_1=\frac{\partial E_1}{\partial S_1}=T_2=\frac{\partial E_2}{\partial S_2},$$</p>

<p>where the temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, the internal energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, and the entropies $S_1$ and $S_2$ are all defined appropriately in operational, thermodynamic terms. On the other hand, we can show that the necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium from the standpoint of statistical mechanics is given by</p>

<p>$$\beta_1 \equiv \frac{\partial \ln \Omega_1}{\partial E_1}= \beta_2 \equiv \frac{\partial \ln \Omega_2}{\partial E_2}.$$</p>

<p>Here, $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are the number of microstates associated with the macrostate of each system. Now, since both of these relations are necessary and sufficient for equilibrium, one equality holds if and only if the other also holds. My question is: How can we proceed from here to show that $S=k_B \ln \Omega$, without limiting our scope to specific examples (like an ideal gas)? In Pathria's text and in other treatments, I don't see much explanation for how this step is justified.</p>

<p>My possibly wrong thoughts are: It seems like we first need to show that $\beta$ is a function of $T$ alone (and indeed the same function of $T$ for both systems), and then show that the form of this function is in fact $\beta \propto T^{-1}$. But I'm not sure how to prove either of those claims.</p>

"269542","The relationship between velocity and radius","<p>I have learned that for an object moving in a circle, there must be an inward force acting upon it in order to cause its inward acceleration. This is sometimes referred to as the centripetal force.</p>

"269545","Doesn't quantum uncertainty disprove string theory?","<p>String theory states that the oscillations of little strings are responsible for all the particles in and the evolution of the universe. The specific type of particle created by a string depends on the energy and the shape of its vibrations. However, in order for a particle to have a definite identity, the string would need to have a definite energy and a definite rate of change. Since the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forbids this, strings would constantly be a random, uncertain jumble and particles could never retain their identities.</p>

<p>Assume both stars were born at the same time, with approximately the same mass, but spinning in opposite directions. I don't know enough about stellar evolution to say whether this is feasible, but we do know binary star systems exist and they must have some chance, over time,  of reaching similar angular momentum values, occasionally in oppositely rotating directions.</p>

<p>My questions are, assuming they are close enough, will this eventually result in a slowdown in their rotations, followed by mutual tidal locking? </p>

<p>If this occurs, and the mass of at least one star is large enough, could we then have a stationary neutron star or black hole?</p>

<p>I realise that the process of creating the dense star will occur after a supernova explosion, which will most likely vaporise the other star in the system.</p>

"269553","Simplest way to store a quantum superposition temporarily","<p>My understanding of the Schroedinger's Cat experiment is that, while it's an amusing thought experiment, the cat would not actually be in a superposition of states because it's just too massive an object. (Not to mention, it would be touching the box, so its movements would affect the larger world, etc.)</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there would be some real way to do something equivalent with inexpensive components. For example, suppose you had a bit of uranium and and a Geiger counter in a box, hooked up to a Raspberry Pi. If the Geiger counter registers something within a certain time frame, that information gets stored in a bit of the memory of the Pi.</p>

<p>Then, you can open the box, plug the Pi into another device, and query the bit state.</p>

<p>In this scenario, there is much less mass involved. As far as I can tell, nothing but electrons were influenced until the box was opened. Not a lot of mass. </p>

<p>The purpose of this scenario would be that someone could hold the box in their hands, and have the clear knowledge of exactly what quantum superposition we're talking about. For a time, while the box is in your hands, that bit would be both flipped and not flipped. If this idea is valid at all! :)</p>

<p>If it isn't valid, I'm wondering if anyone can think of an equivalently cheap, easy way of getting the same effect... there would be a period where you could hold a device in your hands that contains a quantum superposition where anyone could understand what it is that's in a state of superposition, and the device could be checked to make the superposition resolve and find what state it resolves to.</p>

"269555","Sound source localization in cylinder","<p>I am training an animal (let's assume it's a rat) to do sound-source localization in a cylindrical plexiglass chamber that is approximately 30 cm in diameter (see figure). That is, the animal must approach the speaker that is presently on (there are four speakers present, one is on, the other three are off). Sound is 70dB at 10kHz.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nbKLy.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nbKLy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They are getting confused, perhaps due to echoes or reverberations in the chamber. I am not sure how to optimally design the chamber (i.e., frequency and volume of sound source, and diameter of cylinder) to minimize confusion.</p>

<p>In case this is a known problem from partial differential equations, the cylinder is closed on the floor, open on the top and we can consider the speaker a point source for all intents and purposes (it is a piezo buzzer with a pure tone).</p>

<p>We have argued about whether sound should be extra <strong>loud</strong> to help them find the right source, or perhaps <em>quiet</em> to minimize echo/reverb in the chamber. Ultimately I think there is an optimum value to minimize all these effects. I have cracked open my Giancoli Freshman Physics book but it didn't get beyond unencumbered sound travel, and the basics of wave reflection (e.g., angle of reflection = angle of incidence: e.g., what you'd find at Wikipedia - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28physics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28physics%29</a>).</p>

<p>Adding a padded inner surface to dampen reflection is not an option because the animals will climb it and escape to freedom.</p>

<p>Their errors seem fairly random. For instance, when the speaker turns on to the right they go to the left instead. I know they can do these types of tasks in general: when I replace speakers with little LED lights, they learn it in a couple of days and they are very happy. I really think this is a problem with the acoustical physics of my setup.</p>

<p>[If someone were to suggest a simple piece of software to model sound in simple reflective enclosures I would not complain about it--I searched and didn't find it--but I am not asking for such a tool because I know this question would get closed for asking such an off-topic question about tools :)]</p>

"269560","Efficient weak form for numerically generating a static magnetic field from arbitrary current distribution (FEM)","<p>This may stray into computational physics, but I'm curious to know if there is some more efficient way for what I am trying to do. Perhaps a better gauge formulation is needed.</p>

<p>Consider two subdomains ($\Omega_M$, and $\Omega_J$) of some volume $\Omega$. Here, the current distribution $\textbf{J} = \textbf{J}(\textbf{r})$ is nonzero on $\Omega_J$. In a simple example, this can be thought of as a wire embedded in some medium.</p>

<p>The magnetic field $\textbf{H}$ obeys </p>

<p>$$\nabla \times \textbf{H} = \textbf{J}$$</p>

<p>Moving $\textbf{J}$ to the other side, multiplying by a test(trial) function, $\psi_h$ and integrating over the volume $\Omega$ gives,</p>

<p>$$\int\limits_\Omega \,\,d\Omega \,\,\psi_h(\textbf{r})\left[\nabla \times \textbf{H}(\textbf{r}) - \textbf{J}(\textbf{r}) \right] = 0$$</p>

<p>In my opinion, this would be a sufficient residual (three terms for each component) for solving for variables $H_x, H_y, H_z$, given the correct Jacobians supplied for Newton's method. Unfortunately, my solver is not able to find a solution. I've tried a variety of preconditioning methods and Jacobi-free approaches.</p>

<p>Perhaps because this problem (a wire example) has a solution that is degenerate about the cylindrical coordinate $\phi$ rotation and this is the nature of the convergence problems. There is also another condition, that $\nabla \cdot \textbf{B}(\textbf{r}) =  \nabla \cdot (\mu \textbf{H}(\textbf{r})) = 0$ must be satisfied, but I have not seen any improvement on convergence by adding in this constraint.</p>

<p>I'm aware of another approach, where you solve $\nabla^2 \textbf{A}(\textbf{r}) = \textbf{J}(\textbf{r})$ with $\nabla \cdot \textbf{A}(\textbf{r}) = 0$, but this requires higher order elements to handle to second derivative.</p>

<p>Has anyone done this or know of literature to help convey understanding on how to do this <em>on the finite elements</em>? I know commercial codes like ANSYS or Comsol have ""electromagnetics"" packages, but they greatly obscure the governing equations one uses (by not telling the user what the code does!) which in a way is letting the user ignore the important mathematical physics.</p>

"269587","On a measurement level, is quantum mechanics a deterministic theory or a probability theory?","<p>Quantum mechanics is a non-commutative probability theory. As such, it fundamentally behaves differently from classical probability theories. This manifests itself most pronouncedly in the uncertainty principle: a given state can not be assigned a definite position and a definite momentum at the same time.</p>

<p>Enter the measurement: If I understand correctly, when performing a measurement the outcome is a definite result on a classical level. I.e. once we have measured say the position of a particle, the information about where it was is saved in some classical way, where the classicality here emerges through having a large enough system.</p>

<p>To understand this apparent disparity, the concept of wave function collapse was regarded as the solution for a long time, e.g. as part of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Nowadays it is widely accepted that there is no such thing as collapse, instead the quantum state of the universe evolves in a unitary way (i.e. by the Schrödinger equation). The apparent collapse is then explained as a result of interactions in many-particle systems (see e.g. on SE: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/44932/born-rule-and-unitary-evolution/44962#44962"">this</a> and <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/22745/does-measurement-quantum-in-particular-always-increase-the-total-entropy/22786#22786"">this</a>, and links therein. In particular <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2138"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.). This also explains how some many-particle systems may well be approximated as classical and can store the information of measurement outcomes.</p>

<p>The question: Let us suppose we know the complete quantum state of the universe (or a closed system for that matter, to address StéfaneRollandin's concerns that the universe's quantum state may be ill-defined). Can we predict measurement outcomes in the future? Or can we only assign a classical probability? To reformulate: <strong>Is quantum mechanics on a measurement level a deterministic theory or a probability theory?</strong> If it is the latter how can this possibly be consistent with unitarity as described above? And are the probabilities associated still part of a non-commutative probability theory?</p>

<p>Note that in this question, interpretations of QM will not play a role, since by definition they yield the same theory in terms of observable quantities. I would therefore appreciate if an interpretation free answer could be given.</p>

Applying a positive gate voltate now results in a higher electron density and increased mobility inside the 2DEG. Unfortunately, I am not sure whether I understood well why this is happening. My explanation for these phenomena is:</p>

<p>A positive gate voltage causes the electron levels to drop, but as the Fermi level stays constant, there are more electrons inside the well --> charge density is increased.
As scattering with the dopants at the left side limits the mobility, applying a positive gate voltate results in an increased mobility, because the ""new"" electrons inside the 2DEG are shifted to the right side (see band structure), thus further away from the dopants.</p>

The black hole loses mass because the one that falls in has negative energy measured by a far away observer. My question is how can a particle have negative energy in a certain reference frame?

<blockquote>
  <p>On the cylindrical surface, $\mathbf{J}\cdot\hat{n}=0$, else charge would be leaking out into the surrounding space (which we assume to be nonconducting).

<p>I am likely missing something, but this seems like extremely fallacious logic. The current density perpendicular to the wire is obviously zero, but by Ohm's law,</p>

<p>$$\mathbf{J}=\sigma\mathbf{E}$$</p>

<p>If the current density $\mathbf{J}$ is equal to zero, and, as he says, the surrounding medium is non-conductive, then doesn't an essentially zero conductivity and essentially zero current density allow $\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{n}$ to be whatever it wants?</p>

<p>And then for my question. If this is true, there must be some mechanism by which $\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{n}$ <em>is</em> kept equal to zero so the Laplace's solution holds. The horizontal motion of electrons (i.e. electron buildup on the surface of the wire negating any perpendicular component) seems the obvious choice, but given the slow drift velocity of the electrons and the near-c speed of the ""current wave-front"", can this mechanism act fast enough? The horizontal motion of electrons in a wire might just be fast enough to achieve this. And does this account for the uniformity of the electric field in the wire, as well?</p>

"269619","Infer geophysical underground structure from thermal photography of the ground","<p>Is it  possible to determine (approximately of course) the geophysical structure of the underground under a certain region, using only a thermographic picture of the upper ground of the region ? The precise conditions of this are the following:</p>

<p>Input:</p>

<ol>
<li>A termographic picture of the upper ground of a (possible big) given region. The picture is taken from satellite, helicopter or flying drone in the best possible conditions  (no sun, rain, water on the ground, etc). Camera resolution is at least 640x480 and thermographic camera has good thermal sensitivity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Output:</p>

<ol>
<li>A 3D graphic model of the underground part of the region. This model should give approximate information of the geophysical structure on the region at a predetermined deep (this deep can depend on the input image resolution and pixel scale in meters).</li>
<li>Some geophysical data that we wish to approximate is block fault maps, earth  crust, underground cavities, the density of the underground rocks; possible underground zones where hydrocarbons or water could be found.</li>
</ol>

<p>A professor suggested me that the heat values of the upper ground of the region  given by the thermal picture could be used to extrapolate the heat values of the ground to the underground by using a normal distribution to compute  approximate temperature values of computed underground layers, so that using these layers one can approximate the geothermal view of the underground. The professor even suggested that with these technique, one could approximate the thermal gradient of the underground at the moment of taking the upper ground thermal picture.</p>

<p>So, my question is: Is all this right ? Can one approximate the give  output with the input thermal picture ? </p>

"269627","Free particle Schrodinger equation: propagator","<p>I am going through Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics and am having trouble finding the free particle propagator $U(t)$ that satisfies $\lvert\psi (t)\rangle = U(t)\lvert\psi (0)\rangle$ due to the degeneracy of the $E$ eigenkets. Shankar says that if the Hamiltonian has degenerate eigenvalues, we change the propagator equation from $U(t) = \sum_{E} \lvert E\rangle\langle E\rvert e^{-iEt/{\hbar}}$ to $U(t) = \sum_{E} \sum_\alpha \lvert E, \alpha\rangle\langle E, \alpha\rvert e^{-iEt/\hbar} $ where $\lvert E, \alpha \rangle $ are the orthonormal eigenkets for the $E$ eigenspace. This makes sense to me, because it seems like whenever we deal with degeneracy to use a projection. He also says for a Hamiltonian with no degeneracy to change the sum into an integral, so I imagine that for a Hamiltonian with a continuous, degenerate spectrum we would have this propagator: $$ U(t) = \sum_\alpha\int_\Re dE\lvert E, \alpha\rangle\langle E, \alpha\rvert e^{-iEt/\hbar}$$</p>

<p>I tried applying this to the free particle and had some trouble. In the book, after solving for the eigenkets and eigenvalues, $\lvert E\rangle = \lvert p\rangle$ and $p = \pm\sqrt{2mE}$, he chooses the propagator as a function of the momentum eigenvalues $p$ so that $$U(t) = \int_\Re dp\lvert p\rangle\langle p\rvert \exp(-ip^2t/2m)$$
I understand how he got to this, but I'm having some trouble because this doesn't appear to be the same expression that I have above. Splitting the integral up, we have $$U(t) = \int_{-\infty}^0dp\lvert p\rangle\langle p\rvert \exp(-ip^2t/2m) + \int_0^\infty dp\lvert p\rangle\langle p\rvert \exp(-ip^2t/2m)$$
The left integral can changed to an integral over $-p$, and the bounds switch from $0$ to $\infty$ such that:
$$U(t) =  \int_{0}^\infty d(-p)\lvert -p\rangle\langle -p\rvert \exp(-ip^2t/2m) + \int_0^\infty dp\lvert p\rangle\langle p\rvert \exp(-ip^2t/2m)$$
Now we can substitute and interchange $\lvert p\rangle = \lvert E, + \rangle$,  $\lvert -p\rangle = \lvert E, - \rangle$, $E = p^2/2m$, and $dp = \pm mdE/\sqrt{2mE}$ to get:
$$U(t) = \sum_{\alpha = \pm} \int_0^\infty dEm/\sqrt{2mE}\lvert E, \alpha\rangle\langle E, \alpha\rvert e^{-iEt/\hbar} $$
This is the result that we are asked to prove. Why is this not the same as the first expression for the propagator? Where did the extra $ m/\sqrt{2mE} $ come from? Am I just wrong in assuming that that is the general expression for a Hamiltonian with continuous and degenerate eigenvalues?</p>

"269638","Relation between Pair Correlation Function and Static Structure Factor","<p>I am currently looking to calculate the static structure factor of a computer-generated sphere packing I have been referring <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/~fhs/paper275/ordmet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> paper as well as numerous other online sources to try and understand how to accomplish this. </p>

<p>It is my understanding that the pair correlation function $g$ of a homogeneous collection of point objects (such as the centers in a sphere packing) can be defined with the statement that $\rho g(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0})dV$ is the probability of finding an object in in arbitrarily small volume $dV$ at position $\mathbf{r}$ given there is an object at position $\mathbf{r}_{0}$, where $\rho$ is the global number density of the system. This implies that $g$ is a unitless quantity, and that $g(\mathbf{r})=1$ corresponds to a Poisson distribution.</p>

<p>I have read in several places that the structure factor $S(\mathbf{k})$ is related to the pair correlation function by the equation $$S(\mathbf{k})=1+\rho\bar{h}(\mathbf{k})$$ where $\bar{h}(\mathbf{k})$ is the Fourier transform of $h(\mathbf{r})=1-g(\mathbf{r})$, which I assume is also unitless.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find a good explanation of the above relation. It seems to me that if $\rho$ signifies the global number density then  $S(\mathbf{k})$ would depend on the units used to measure to measure the size of the system. Is there some kind of unitless density or am I misinterpreting some other part of the equation?</p>

<p>My knowledge of this type of statistical mechanics is still somewhat rudimentary, so any explanation or background information would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

"269639","Energy Spectrum and Gauge Transformations","<p>There is a <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/177102/"">question</a> in SE about the fact that the Hamiltonian isn't invariant under the EM gauge transformations. I wanted to ask about its consequences here.</p>

<p>I know that in general, the Hamiltonian and wave functions would transform under the gauge transformation in such a way that the Schrödinger equation remains true. Specifically, if under a gauge transformation $H$ goes to $\tilde{H}$ and $\psi$ goes to $\tilde{\psi}$, We still have:
$$ \tilde{H} \tilde{\psi}=i\hbar\partial_t\tilde{\psi}$$</p>

<p>Also, I know under a time-independent gauge transformation, if $\psi$ is a eigenstate of Hamiltonian with energy $E$, the $\tilde{\psi}$ would be the eigenstate of $\tilde{H}$ with the same energy. So the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian is invariant under the time-independent gauge transformations. But what confuses me, are the time-dependent gauge transformations. It can be seen that under the gauge transformation $$(\phi,\mathbf{A})\to(\phi+\partial_t \lambda,\mathbf{A}-\nabla \lambda)\qquad (1),$$ the eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian transforms to:
$$\tilde{H}\tilde{\psi}=E\tilde{\psi}+\partial_t\lambda(x,t) \tilde{\psi}\qquad (2)$$
The derivation of this relation is appended at the end of the question. So as it can be seen $\tilde{\psi}$ isn't anymore the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian and it seems that the energy spectrum would also change. I mean that even the energy differences would change under this gauge transformation.</p>

<p>This somehow looks odd to me. Take for example the hydrogen atom. On one hand, we know that the $13.6$ eV can be measured in experiment, or the energy differences between various level can be observed with spectroscopy techniques, but on the other hand they are somehow dependent on the gauge we choose. Take into account that gauge transformations doesn't represents a physical change in the system like changing the observer, but it's just a reformulation of the same problem. It seems that even the orbital shapes would change under time-dependent gauge transformations.</p>

<p>Is the above reasoning correct? Is energy deference an observable physical quantity or not? or maybe only the eigenvalues of time-independent Hamiltonians represents the energy levels of the system and we should look at time-dependent Hamiltonians as just the time evolution generator and do not relate its spectrum to energies of the system. Can someone clarify the situation?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Proof of Eq. 2</strong>:(I have set $\hbar=e=1$ for simplicity)</p>

<p>Suppose that $H=\frac{(p-A)^2}{2m}+\phi$ is the systems Hamiltonian in the original gauge and $\psi$ is one of its eigenvectors with energy $E$, so in the position representation:
$$H\psi=[\frac{(-i\nabla-A)^2}{2m}+\phi]\psi(x)=E\psi(x),\qquad (3)$$
Now consider the gauge transformation which is given by Eq. (1), under which the Hamiltonian transforms to:
$$\tilde H=\frac{(p-A+\nabla \lambda)^2}{2m}+\phi+\partial_t \lambda$$
and also the $\psi$ wave function would go to:
$$\tilde \psi(x,t)=\exp{[-i\lambda(x,t)]}\psi(x,t)$$
It is easy to see that:
$$(-i\nabla-A+\nabla \lambda)\exp{[-i\lambda(x,t)]}\psi(x,t)=\exp{[-i\lambda(x,t)]}(-i\nabla-A)\psi(x,t),\qquad (4)$$
If we operate the $\tilde H$ on the $\tilde \psi$ form left and use Eq. 4 twice:
$$\tilde H \tilde \psi =\exp[-i\lambda(x,t)]\Big(\frac{(-i\nabla-A)^2}{2m}+\phi\Big)\psi(x,t) +\partial_t \lambda\exp[-i\lambda(x,t)]\psi(x,t)$$
but the expression in the big parentheses is just the original Hamiltonian $H$ and according to Eq. 3, it can be replace by $E$, So:
$$\tilde H\tilde \psi=E\tilde\psi +(\partial_t\lambda)\tilde\psi $$
which completes the proof.</p>

"269661","Why is the energy expressed in an electron orbital change of state electromagnetic (photon)?","<p>As I understand it, Schrodinger's wave equation predicts the allowable energy states an electron can have under the electromagnetic forces of a given nucleus (and I assume other 'orbital' electrons).

Schrodinger's equation simply gives the quantity of the energy difference. </p>

<p>What causes this expressed energy to become/be electromagnetic? Has the electron or its charge been 'jerked' in space in some oscillatory fashion (congruent with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) by the energy loss, as is the method to create lower frequency electromagnetic emissions in an antenna?  Has the electron spin fluctuated to initiate an electromagnetic emission? Is the 'orbital energy state' of the electron somehow a non-propagating (stationary) electromagnetic energy that lets some of its energy 'loose' when the electron changes state to another non-propagating electromagnetic energy state? </p>

"269684","The Validity of a Heuristic Explanation of Black Hole Complementarity?","<p>In one of the messenger lectures at Cornell in 2013, Leonard Susskind gave a heuristic argument for black hole complementarity. Suppose Alice is stationed far away from a Schwarzschild black hole and a particle Bob falls freely through the event horizon. There is a conflict of principles in the sense that Alice would believe that the event horizon is very hot for Bob, and think that Bob will be burnt, while Bob will theoretically experience nothing special, given the equivalence principle. </p>

<p>Here is Susskind's argument to resolve the apparent conflict: When Bob is a distance $\lambda$ away from the event horizon, Alice wants to tell if Bob has been burnt by doing an experiment(i.e. by shining photons at Bob and measuring its position). However, in order to resolve Bob (to reduce the measurement uncertainty to below $\lambda$), Alice has to shine photons of short enough wavelength and thus high enough energy (due to the diffraction limit of optics, used in Heisenberg's heuristic demonstration of measurement uncertainty principle). It turns out that by trying to measure the position of Bob and detecting whether or not it has been burnt, the photons sent by Alice would have burnt Bob anyways. So there is some kind of complementarity in place.</p>

<p>However, the argument seems to break down given that the diffraction limit has been broken in recent years by quantum measurement techniques (for example, see this paper by <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.253601/%22Mankei%20Tsang%22"" rel=""nofollow"">Mankei Tsang</a>). So is it possible to modify Susskind's argument to make it still work? Or is there a more technical and fundamental argument that will circumvent this problem? </p>

<p>Any suggestions for readings related to this topic would also be nice!</p>

"269690","Proper definition of the Wannier function","<p>I am studying the construction of the Wannier functions for 1D system with periodic boundary conditions and my reasoning seems to be a little bit different from what I can find in textbooks. </p>

<p>First of all, if my lattice has $M$ nodes then wave vector belonging to the 1st Brillouin zone is discrete and of the form:
$$k_{n} = -\frac{\pi}{d}\left(\frac{2}{M}n - 1 \right)$$
where $n = 0, 1, \ldots, M$ and $d$ - lattice spacing. So, $-\pi/d \le k_n \le \pi/d$. In total we have $M+1$ different values. Once we have normalized Bloch functions $\psi_{n}(x)$ we shall define Wannier function as:
$$W(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M+1}}\sum\limits_{n=0}^{M}\psi_{n}(x)$$
with $1/\sqrt{M+1}$ coefficient ensuring normalization:
$$\int\limits_{0}^{L}dx\ W^{*}(x)W(x) = 1$$
where $L = d\cdot M$. We use the fact that:
$$\int\limits_{0}^{L}dx\ \psi^{*}_{n}(x)\psi_{m}(x) = \delta_{n,m}$$
Most textbooks define Wannier function with $1/\sqrt{M}$ which for my taste is incorrect because Wannier function would not be properly normalized. What do you think?</p>

<p>Second thing. Let's consider the simplest case of free particle. Then Bloch functions are the following:
$$\psi_{n}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}}e^{i k_n x}$$
According to my definition of Wannier function we get:
$$W(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L(M+1)}}\sum\limits_{n=0}^{M}e^{i k_n x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L(M+1)}}\frac{\sin\left[\frac{\pi}{d}\left(\frac{1}{M} + 1 \right)x\right]}{\sin\left[\frac{\pi}{d}\frac{1}{M}x\right]}$$
In textbooks apart from the already mentioned difference between $M$ and $M+1$ they write:
$$W(x) = \sqrt{\frac{M}{L}}\frac{\sin(x \pi/d)}{x \pi/d}$$
I checked numerically that for large $M$ 
$$\frac{\sin\left[\frac{\pi}{d}\left(\frac{1}{N} + 1 \right)x\right]}{\sin\left[\frac{\pi}{d}\frac{1}{N}x\right]} \approx M\frac{\sin(x \pi/d)}{x \pi/d}$$
Do you know how to show that?</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>According to definition 1st Brillouin zone in 1D is a set of wave vectors confined to a region:
$$-\frac{\pi}{d} \le k_n &lt; \frac{\pi}{d}$$
where 
$$k_n = \frac{\pi}{d}\left(\frac{2}{M}n - 1 \right)$$
with $n = 0,1,\ldots, M-1$. With this definition Wannier function for free particles looks like this
$$W(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M L}}\sum\limits_{n=0}^{M-1}e^{i k_n x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M L}}\left\{ \cot\left( \frac{\pi}{d M}x \right) \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{d}x \right) - i\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{d}x \right) \right\}$$
For large $M$ the above function behaves as:
$W(x) \approx \sqrt{\frac{M}{L}}\left\{ \frac{\sin(\pi x/d)}{\pi x/d} - i\sin(\pi x/d)\right\}$
which is not the textbook result due uncompensated imaginary part. However, in the original paper by Kohn he replaced discrete sum by integral. In my opinion it is not well defined (additional term is missing). Consider the <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Euler%E2%80%93Maclaurin_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">Euler-Maclaurin formula</a>
$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{M-1}f(n) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{M} f(n) - f(M) \approx \int\limits_{0}^{M}dn\ f(n) + \frac{1}{2}\left(f(0) - f(M) \right) = \frac{d M}{2 \pi}\int\limits_{-\pi/d}^{\pi/d}dk \tilde{f}(k) + \frac{1}{2}\left(f(0) - f(M) \right)$$
Kohn and other authors forgot about the second term which isn't small and actually doesn't depend on $M$ in the case of free particle. Now discrete formula gives the same answer as integral representation - Wannier function is not purely real as long as we do not include two extreme points in the summation. </p>

"269697","Why can't rotating magnets in space or zero gravity be used to create infinite energy?","<p>I would like to know if a system like the one below will possibly work.</p>

<p>I understand that the laws of physics forbid the ""creation"" of energy but despite my efforts I haven't been able to figure out why this system will not work, although it has some small problems with exactness. </p>

<p>Please explain to me the various reasons a device like this wouldn't work.</p>

<p><strong>The Device:</strong></p>

<p>Three discs are rotating in zero gravity, outside of the Earth's magnetic field. Each disc has on its edge one magnet. Two discs have permanent magnets and the other possesses an electromagnet.  </p>

<p>These three discs are rotating in a clockwise direction but are otherwise stationary. They are also placed around bars that tether permeable materials together which also rotate but in an anti-clockwise direction, as the discs rotate and ""connect/attract"" these materials.   </p>

<p>Z = Disc with weakest permanent magnet, the first magnet to interact </p>

<p>Y = Disc with the stronger permanent magnet, the second magnet to interact </p>

<p>X = Disc with the strongest magnet also an electromagnet</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YZzP4.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YZzP4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>One could ""harvest"" the energy between them but before their rotational paths (maintained perpetually as potential energy in zero-gravity) force them to part another stronger disc/magnet would drag the permeable material out of the weaker magnet's effective range. </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LYTGr.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LYTGr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Finally it would come time for the electromagnet to interact, dragging the permeable material from the now weaker magnet allowing it to maintain its rotations without slowing down. The energy between the permeable material and the magnet/electromagnet would be ""harvested"". Before their rotational paths would force them apart the electromagnet would turn off and the cycle would start over.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/j9FDP.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/j9FDP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I should mention that all pieces are rotating at the same speed and can be made to have the same angular rotation if necessary. More discs can be used without causing problems. Each disc is at a different height to prevent any interruptions.</p>

<p>If each magnet is twice as powerful as the other then technically couldn't one potentially ""harvest"" 75% of the amount of energy expended by the electromagnet from the permanent magnets alone and in turn ""harvest"", for example, 50% of the energy from the electromagnet, essentially using permanent magnets to cover our losses and then some while the electromagnet would be used as a sort of control switch? </p>

<p>I'd appreciate any answers. </p>

"269698","States after measurement","<p>I am learing about quantum mechanics, and I am quite unclear about the the role of measurement and the density operator.</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal H$ be a Hilbert space, $\psi(t) \in \mathcal H$, $O$ be a bounded hermitian operator (“observable”) with discrete eigenvalues $o_n$.</p>

<p>Immediately after a measurement at time $t=t_0$ yielding $o_i$, the state will be projected into the Eigenspace of the operator for that corresponding eigenvalue:
$$\left\{ \phi: \|\phi\| = 1 \:\wedge\: O\phi = o_i \phi  \right\} = \{\phi_{i\lambda}: \lambda \in \{0..d_i\}\}$$

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Is it correct, that for non-degenerate eigenvalues, the resulting state must be <em>pure</em>, since we project only against $\phi_{i0}$ being an eigenstate itself and not a superposition of multiple eigenstates?</p></li>

How can a regular operator have an expectation value that is not a complex number?</p>

<p>To me it seems that we formally extend our Hilbert space to something where vectors cannot just have complex numbers as coefficients, but also polynomials of Grassmann variables. What's the best way to think of this? Can I use such a state to describe a concrete physical state? What happens if the number operator has an expectation value containing Grassmann variables?</p>

<p>Magnetic field which is generated by this solenoid is proportional to the number of turns <code>N</code>. </p>

<p>But why? What changes if we melt all wires together and make copper tube? Of course we will need a gap. But finally we'll get coil with 1 turn of very thick wire.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VQQqj.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VQQqj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Will such coil generate smaller magnetic field with the same current? And if yes, then why?</p>

<p>I think I should think on current density and probably with ""melted"" wire I should make the same current density, i.e. <code>N</code> times larger current then in normal coil.</p>

<p>But why is it possible to avoid the nesessity of bigger current by just splitting wire into thin channels and looping? Why does this trick work?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>So, regard two coils on two pictures. The number of loops is the same and equals <code>N</code>, but in case <code>(1)</code> loops are connected serially and in case <code>(2)</code> loops are connected parallel. The movement of electrons is identical in both cases, so the current in case <code>(2)</code> is <code>N</code> times bigger than in case <code>(1)</code>.</p>

<p>Magnetic field is identical.</p>

<p>The question IS: why do we prefer case <code>(1)</code>? Why is it easier to run electrons in serial connection? Why isn't these devices just technically equivalent?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Suppose, we have one ""sick"" turn, which has resistance of</p>

<p>$R_0$</p>

<p>If we connect the voltage $U$ to it, then we'll get current of</p>

<p>$I = {U \over R_0}$</p>

<p>Magnetic effects are proportional to (1) current and (2) number of turns, because effects of all turns sum to each other (approximately).</p>

<p>So, we wish to keep the product $NI$ constant</p>

<p>$NI = J_0 = const$</p>

<p>Suppose we split the wire into $N$ turns, remaining the total cross-section of copper the same.</p>

<p>The resistance of each turn will be</p>

<p>$r = {R_0 N}$</p>

<p>because it's cross section is now Nth part of total initial cross-section and $1/R$ is proportional to cross-section.</p>

<p>The total resistance of the coil will be </p>

<p>$R = r N = R_0 N^2$</p>

<p>because turns are connected in series. I.e. current should pass thinner wire and longer length of this wire.</p>

<p>If we apply the voltage of $U$ we will get current of</p>

<p>$I = \frac{U}{R_0 N^2}$</p>

<p>and $J$ of</p>

<p>$J = \frac{U}{R_0 N^2} \cdot N = \frac{U}{R_0 N}$</p>

"269739","Interpretation of Evanescent Elastic Waves for Material Damage","<p>In elastodynamic theory, when the slowness vector is imaginary, the resulting elastic waves are called evanescent. I have read that this corresponds to exponential decay.
I have also read that complex stiffness tensor corresponds to an attenuative material, and therefore a decay. Mathematically and computationally, this is fine for me,
but I do not really understand this conceptually. </p>

<p>Does this mean that when a wavenumber (eigenvalue) is purely imaginary, there is simply no wave (i.e. oscillation of the material) at all in that direction (at least for some frequencies)? How does this make sense in terms of conservation of energy?</p>

<p>More specifically, suppose we consider elastic waves generated by striking a piece of anisotropic tissue. One of the wavenumbers of the resulting waveform is purely positive imaginary in a given frequency band. What does this mean in terms of damage to the (fibrous microstructure of the) tissue? Certainly the wave is damaging the tissue as it travels, but is the direction corresponding to the imaginary waveform somewhat protected by the ""filtering"" effect of the imaginary wavenumber? If it is as if the material were attenuating the wave to drain it of energy in that direction (as a complex stiffness tensor would seem to) would that not mean the energy is being absorbed into the material right away (and perhaps damaging it more than if it were ""spread out"", so to speak)?</p>

"269748","Why do these experiments contradict the accepted theory about puddles? (+ my work)","<p>A few months ago, I tried to tackle the problem of finding the shape, the height and other properties of a puddle (whenever a few mL of some liquid are dropped in a ""uniform way"" so that the puddle remains approximately circular). Trying to find the height, dimensional analysis with density, gravity and superficial tension gives the ""famous"" (appears in most of the books about this problem) formula: </p>

<p>$$ H = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}} $$ </p>

<p>But as soon as I found this, I discarded it (at this point I hadn't researched anything about the problem) because it seemed to contradict the experiments I'd done so far! I had dropped a few mL of water and of honey, and, as I expected, the honey puddle was higher than the water one (3 mm vs 1.5 mm approx). But this is contradictory! The superficial tension of honey is similar to that of water, but the density is significantly higher, so the height should be lower. </p>

<p>What does this mean? Is it because the viscosity of the honey makes it ""stop"" from spilling on the ground and makes it stick on top of the honey that's already on the ground? I've tried a different approach which leads me to a formula that agrees much more with the experiments, but it's completely different from this one and doesn't have the theoretical justification that this one does.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Here's what I obtained so far and some of the experiments I did (keep in mind that I didn't have much precision due to lack of any sophisticated instruments). (All measurements where taken about 20-25 degrees Celsius)</p>

<p>$$ H = \kappa \sqrt[\leftroot{-1}\uproot{2}\scriptstyle 15]{\frac{\eta^2 \sigma^6}{g^7 \rho^8}} $$
Where $\eta$ is the viscosity, $\sigma$ the superficial tension, $g$ is gravity and $\rho$ is density. The value of the constant is $\kappa = 0.89 \pm 0.24 $. With this I can ""predict"" the height of a puddle of water, honey, glycerin and alcohol.
$$ H_{water}^{theory} = (1.1 \pm 0.4) mm \leftrightarrow H_{water}^{experiment} = (1.5 \pm 0.5) mm$$
$$ H_{alcohol}^{theory} = (0.8 \pm 0.3) mm \leftrightarrow H_{alcohol}^{experiment} = (0.8 \pm 0.5) mm$$
$$ H_{honey}^{theory} = (3.0 \pm 1.1) mm \leftrightarrow H_{honey}^{experiment} = (3.0 \pm 0.5) mm $$
$$ H_{glycerin}^{theory} = (2.4 \pm 0.9) mm \leftrightarrow H_{glycerin}^{experiment} = (2.6 \pm 0.2) mm$$</p>

<p>Also, the formula I've obtained for the shape of the drop is (in two dimensions):
$$ H(r) = H_m(1-e^{\frac{tan{\theta_C}}{H_m}(\left|r \right| - R)}) $$
With $R$ the radius of the puddle, $\theta_C$ the contact angle and $H_m$ the maximum height of the puddle (can be obtained by the formula before) and the radius is approximately $R = \sqrt{\frac{V}{\pi H_m}} $.

"269769","Spectral covers and a specific exact short sequence","<p>I have a question about the spectral cover construction of Friedman, Morgan, and Witten (typically used to map a description in heterotic string theory into F-theory). I realise this is a highly specialised topic; I am asking in the hope that there might be some specialists around. I also realise this may be more appropriate in the mathematics StackExchange, and may post a question there later.</p>

<p>Specifically I have  a question about the more mathematical FMW paper, `Vector bundles over elliptic fibrations': <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9709029"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9709029</a></p>

<p>Consider the second short exact sequence on page 72, of sheaves on the elliptic fibration $Z$ (the one involving $V_{A,a}$ sheaves). The three sheaves appearing in the first two slots of the sequence are I think supposed to all be vector bundles (the $V_{A,a}$ sheaves should be vector bundles since they are supposed to correspond to the spectral cover description). But the sheaf in the third slot is, I think, zero (that is, not a trivial bundle, but actually just zero) away from the subspace $D$, and hence is not a vector bundle. How then could both the left and the middle sheaves in the sequence be vector bundles? Additionally, away from the subspace $D$, do we then have an isomorphism between the sheaves in the first two slots? And in the subspace $D$ (where the final sheaf is not just zero), do we just have the ordinary quotient relation between the three sheaves?</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>The short exact sequence in question is, $$0\to V_{A,a}(n)\to V_{A,a}(n-1)\oplus \pi^*L^a\to(\pi^*L^a)|D\to0\,.$$ The space where these bundles (or sheaves) live is an elliptic fibration $\pi:Z\to B$ (and $L^a$, where it appears, is being pulled back by $\pi^*$ to the space $Z$). The $|D$ denotes restriction to a subspace $D$ of $Z$. Here $V_{A,a}(m)$ is a sheaf, and specifically is I believe supposed to be a vector bundle for both values of $m$ seen in the sequence. The final term in the sequence is I think not a vector bundle (it is 0 away from the subspace $D$), and this gives rise to my questions above. (Essentially this is a question about exact sequences of sheaves, but as it appeared in a physics context I thought I'd try my luck finding someone on here who is familiar with this spectral cover construction.)</p>

<p>Are the following answers correct?  I try to give some justification. 
(a) positive (b) negative (c) negative </p>

<p>There are three forces acting on the block: the hand, gravity, and the normal force.  The force of gravity equals the normal force, so the net force on the block equals the force of the hand.  In (a), the work done by the hand is positive since the direction of motion is the same as the direction of the force.  In (b), the work done by gravity on the block is negative because the direction of motion is opposite the direction of the force.  The block exerts a force on the hand that is smaller in magnitude than the force of the hand on the block (otherwise the block would not move).  Therefore, in (c) the block does negative work on the hand.  </p>

"269774","Speed of sound at phase transition -- does percolation theory describe it?","<p>I was discussing with a friend whether we expected liquid water or ice to have a higher speed of sound, near freezing; we figured it would be water since it was more dense. It turned out to be ice (by a factor of 3), which I guess is due to the much stronger coupling of molecules. Okay.</p>

<p>The only literature I could find talked about speed of sound as a function of temperature, though. If we control the pressure and volume of water instead, we get a mixture; how does the speed of sound appear here? I mean at the macroscale, so that it is approximately uniform (despite the phase mixing).</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this something that can efficiently be predicted by knowing the solid speed and liquid speeds. As we vary the solid concentration by varying the pressure, I think we could model the structure of the solid component with percolation theory. Then if we get arbitrarily large clusters of solid, they would mediate the sound at that speed. If we don't get large clusters, then the sound travels through the solid for parts and alternately travels through liquid. I would expect this model to not work if the extra ""noise"" in the structure of the liquid, at the small scale, would cause more reflections back and forth and reduce the overall speed.</p>

"269797","Mass density of a cylinder increasing with the square of the radius","<p>I’ve had to deal with a question like this on a test on friday and I just can’t get it out of my mind.</p>

<p>I was supposed to calculate the moment of inertia of a cylinder with an inhomogenous yet continuous mass density distribution. The density was supposed to “increase with the square of the radius,” starting at $m=0$ for $r=0$.</p>

<p>Now, moment of inertia aside, the interesting part of this task (I think) is finding an expression for the mass density. For the mass density of a cylinder for which we put a coordinate system at its center we can say that
$$\rho(\vec{r})=\frac{m}{\pi R^2L}\Theta(R-r)\Theta(\frac{L}{2}-|z|).$$
Where $R$ is the radius of the cylinder and $L$ is its height. This leaves the mass density at $\rho(\vec{r})=0$ anywhere outside of the cylinder and inside it’s just $\rho(\vec{r})=\frac{m}{V}$, but how would I go about meeting this condition above? The volume is constant; it’s not changing as there are no chips of the cylinder flying off, so the only way to make the mass density increase with the square of the radius is for the mass itself to be a function of $r$.</p>

<p>So here’s where I’m stuck: I could obviously write the mass as a function of $r$ like so:
$$m(\vec{r})=m_0 r^2,$$
but that would completely mess up my units in the end. Not only would the mass suddenly no longer be $kg$, but $kgm^2$ ‒ the mass density $\rho$ would change as well, as it would turn from $\frac{kg}{m^3}$ to $\frac{kg}{m}$! </p>

<p>I just don’t see an approach to this. Am I misinterpreting the task? Am I missing something crucial or am I making things too complicated for myself?</p>

<p>I appreciate the help.</p>

<p>[UPDATE]</p>

<p>I get what you’re trying to say and I’ve actually tried this before, too, but I got a weird result.</p>

<p>Taking your function as an example, I can integrate over the volume using cylindrical coordinates:
$$\begin{eqnarray}\rho(\vec{r})&amp;=&amp;\int_{0}^{R}{dr'r'}\int_{0}^{2\pi}{d\varphi'}\int_{-\frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}}{dz'}Cr'^2\\
&amp;=&amp;C2\pi L\int_{0}^{R}{dr'r'^3}\\
\rightarrow\rho(\vec{r})&amp;=&amp;\frac{C\pi LR^4}{2}\end{eqnarray}$$
Now if I solve this for $C$ to take a look at the units, I get
$$\Rightarrow C=\frac{2\rho}{\pi LR^4}$$
and therefore
$$[C]=\frac{\frac{kg}{m^3}}{m^5}=\frac{kg}{m^8}$$
and that’s kind of . . . wrong?</p>

<p>The density would then be
$$[\rho]=[Cr^2]=\frac{kgm^2}{m^8}=\frac{kg}{m^6}$$
and that can’t be right. Where did I screw up?</p>

<p>If I take the result of my integral and equate that to the total mass, my density would look even weirder:
$$\begin{eqnarray}\rho&amp;=&amp;\frac{m}{V}\\
&amp;=&amp;\frac{C\pi LR^4}{2\pi R^2L}\\
\rho&amp;=&amp;\frac{CR^2}{2}\end{eqnarray}$$
In units the density would, again, look like so:
$$[\rho]=\Bigg[\frac{CR^2}{2}\Bigg]=\frac{kgm^2}{m^8}=\frac{kg}{m^6}.$$</p>

<p>So, somewhere in all of this I’m making a terrible mistake and I don’t see where. :/</p>

"269811","Why the Doppler Ultrasound beam needs to be looking directly down at a pipe","<p>So I was doing a question about ""Doppler Ultrasound""</p>

<p>It states that a Doppler ultrasound uses soundwaves at a frequency much higher than what humans can hear. They can me used to measure the speed of fluid in underground pipes by reflecting high frequency sound waves (from 2-18 MHz) off moving liquid and analyzing the reflected waves.</p>

<p>The question is</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the limitations of the Doppler Ultrasound is that the beam needs to be 'looking' as directly down the pipe as possible.
    Explain why:</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I was thinking this is due to the Doppler machine which emits waves, which reflect of a liquid down the pipe. If the beam is misaligned, then the emitted waves from the machine could hit the walls of the pipe rather than a straight reflection from the machine to the liquid and back but I am unsure...</p>

<p>I was also thinking the change in frequency observed is dependent on the relative motion between he source and the observer. Therefore, only the component of the velocity directly towards or away from the machine will cause a Doppler shift hence it beam needs to be looking down to observe the doppler effect. </p>

"269816","What kind of effect would cosmic expansion have on planetary motion or keplerian orbit?","<p>The question is, if two following phenomena are thought to effect to the motion of the planet that orbits a star:</p>

<ol>
<li>Celestial body is pulled by some massive star by ordinary Newtonian gravity:</li>
</ol>

<p>$$ m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -  G \frac{Mm}{r^2}   $$</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>There is additional radial velocity component</li>
</ol>

<p>$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = kr\ ,\qquad k &lt;&lt; 1 $$
 or (linear approximation):
$$ r(t) = r_0 (1+ kt) , k &lt;&lt; 1\ , $$</p>

<p>that pulls the body $m$ away from the mass $M$ - and <strong>that is independent from the gravity</strong> (that means it happens also in zero gravity), what kind of solutions would these 2 rules give for orbits and can the orbits be stationary in some situations?</p>

<hr>

<p>The Newtonian gravitation law only, when the mass $M \gg m$, would result a Keplerian orbit: $$ r(\theta) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos(\theta)}$$
that is circle, ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Partial answers:</strong></p>

<p><strong>A. At least the circular motion equilibrium can be maintained at the start</strong> simply by demanding that the initial velocity of the body to be not exactly tangential, but have a small radial component inward:</p>

<p>$$ v_{initial} = v_{tan} + v_{r}\ , $$ where
$$ v_{r} = -kr  $$</p>

<p>Now the radial component of initial velocity would cancel the radial velocity $kr$ at initial time. What would yield to the familiar equilibrium equation for circular motion:</p>

<p>$$ v^2/r = GM/r^2 $$</p>

<p><strong>B. Also, when the planet is put into aphelion point of the orbit</strong>, where the Newtonian gravitation is in then minimum and according Newtonian gravitation law its velocity would be perpendicular to $r$ and in the minimum, the initial velocity should be slightly inward from the tangential velocity $v$, if this point would be the true aphelion point. From this initial condition, the first guess is that the resultant orbit or trajectory should be then somewhere between the aphelion circle $r_{max}$ and perihelion circle $r_{min}$ -at least during the first cycle.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The first guess</strong> for the orbit equation is simply:
$$ r(\theta) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos(\theta)}(1+kt)$$
or
$$ r(\theta) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos(\theta)}e^{kt}\ ,$$
if nothing else (e.g gravity of other planets, orbital decay, etc) effect on the motion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The reason</strong> why I ask this question is that I would like to think <strong>what would happen if the cosmological expansion of the universe would effect on the celestial mechanics</strong>. I have read that <strong>this is not thought to be true however, cosmic expansion is not effecting the solar system</strong>. But if it would be true, the cosmic expansion would be described approximately by equations:
$$r = r_0(1 + Ht) $$ that is linear approximation when $t$ is small, or $$ \frac{dr}{dt} = Hr\ , $$ which is another approximation when $t$ is small, whose solution is exponential function. </p>

<p>And the value for $H$ would be around $H = 2.20 \times 10^{-18}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ or $H = 6.93 \times 10^{-11}\, \mathrm{year}^{-1}$, that is simply the Hubble constant is the units [1/s] and [1/year].</p>

<p>With this value for $k$, for example Earth-Moon distance 384000 km should  increase by 2.63 cm/year, and Earth-Sun distance $150\times10^6\, \mathrm{km}$ would increase by 10.4 m/year, if nothing cancels this effect. </p>

<p>The observed values are 3.8 cm/year (radar measurements) and 10.4 cm/year (That is 100 times smaller. I don't know how the value of AU is actually measured). The Moon-Earth system is thought to separate due to tidal forces, but it is unclear to me how much this effect really contribute to the increase of Earth-Moon distance.</p>

To make the extra dimensions to be consistent with our observed world, we need to ask for that the extra dimensions are very small so that they are invisible. But I still have a question about the KK theory.</p>

<p>Let $x$ denotes the extended dimensions and $y$ denotes the compacted extra dimensions. Then we can consider a particle state $|x',p_y\rangle$ representing the position eigenstate for the $x$ and momentum eigenstate for the $y$. The wave function then is 
$$\psi(x,y)=\langle x, y|x',p_y\rangle\sim\delta(x-x')e^{ip_yy}.$$ 
Then probability of detecting such a particle in the extended spacetime is
$$\frac{\int dx |\psi(x,y=y_0)|^2}{\int dxdy |\psi(x,y)|^2}\sim 0,\tag{1}$$ 
where I have assumed that our extended world is located at $y_0$ of the extra dimensions. Eq.(1) is true no matter how small the extra dimensions are because the measure of our extended world is zero in the total spacetime. So why can people accept KK mechanism if there are no some localization mechanisms? (note that the localization mechanism was only proposed for the brane world). Put it another way, why didn't people propose the localization mechanism for KK theory? Why the localization mechanism was proposed only in the brane world scenario?</p>

  <p>Compactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional.

In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory.</p>

"269849","If orbital shells are just probability functions, why are quantum numbers only ever integers?","<p>Quantum numbers are supposed to denote every individual orbital. But if orbital shells are probability functions, then orbitals can't be definite, solid things. So in that case, there can be variation in the amount of energy given off when an electron drops between shells - it might, say, give off a tiny little bit more energy and drop to just below the orbital shell. Isn't this possible since orbitals are just probability functions - like ""Here's where the electron <em>probably</em> is""? Not entirely sure where I was going with this, but I think the final question is, how come quantum numbers are only ever integers?</p>

<p>Edit: My question is about why quantum numbers as taught in schools are always integers. ""Orbitals"" as predicted by the Bohr model are in fact clouds of electrons, probability functions about where an electron <em>probably</em> is rather than a definite statement about where it definitely is. That means there's got to be wiggle room about how far an electron can be from the nucleus.</p>

<p>So does that mean that quantum numbers are an oversimplification, or just averages? Or am I just misunderstanding the whole ""orbitals are just probability clouds"" thing?</p>

<p>In some references, people define the maximally entangled state as the one whose reduced density matrix (for the lower dimensional subsystem) is maximally mixed. I believe I understand the concept of maximally mixed - it just means that the state is descibed by an ensemble with every possible quantum state having the same probability (in some sense it describes the most random ensemble one can have with a certain basis of quantum states). Now what I don't understand in a clear way is why we define a maximally entangled state in such a way - is there any more insightful reason or is it just a definition that is consistent? </p>

<p>Indeed, this question arised when I was thinking about entanglement entropy. Still in the bipartite system, one can show that for a pure state of the system, the Von Neumann entropy of the subsystem has some properties that lead us to define this entropy as a measure of entanglement, yet these same properties are dependent on our notion of maximally entangled that I don't understand (<a href=""http://www.mpmueller.net/seminar/talk2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpmueller.net/seminar/talk2.pdf</a> see Theorem.6)</p>

What I fail to see is how moving too quickly could also impair cooling performance as stated in a lot of online forums. One argument I clearly remember from reading about this a while back was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shouldn't crank the pump speed too fast or the water won't have time to pick up the heat from the waterblock as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That, however, makes no sense to me. It's not like the fluid and the block are interfacing in a discrete frame-like manner where if you speed it up it'd be somehow 'waiting' for the next water frame to come around, there's a continuous flow so I don't see how that would be an issue.</p>

<p>How does fluid speed influence the cooling efficiency in a closed loop?</p>

<p>The bottom line of my question is where does the two slit contradicts newtonian physics?</p>

<p>It has been done on photons, electrons and even small molecules resulting in patterns that suggest wave behaviour of those particles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With photons the physical attributes of the pattern are connected to the frequency/energy of the emitted light, which is a wave with wavelength in 400-700nm, right?</p></li>
<li><p>With electrons and molecules is it (the pattern) not be related to the centripetal force exerted by the electrical respectively gravitational force applied on electrons/molecules by the edges of the slits (that have a certain crystalline structure)?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also... why isn't refraction like the photo-electrical effect a proof that light is made also by quanta of energy (photons) that can act like a particle with electro-magnetic or even in the first case kinetic energy? Just because it contradicts math equations we are anyway unable to follow logically-what is the explanation on the refraction phenomenon?</p>

<p>When we measure spin of an electron in a certain direction, we are actually, setting it up in that direction. That does not sound like measurement. Wouldn't alignment be more appropriate term for use? </p>

<p>Doesn't the probability wave give chances of aligning (or not aligning) the particle in certain direction, given a specific spin direction prior to measurement. That specific direction also by the way, we have to set beforehand, otherwise, we would not know what it is.</p>

"269917","Why is black hole entropy not an extensive quantity?","<p>The Bekenstein entropy for a black hole is proportional to the surface area $A$ of the black hole
$$
S_{BH} = \frac{k_B}{4 l_P} A
$$
with the Planck length $l_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}$.</p>

<p>The area is the surface of a sphere with Schwarzschild radius $r_s = \frac{2 M G}{c^2}$, so 
$$
A = 4 \pi r_s^2 = 16\pi \left(\frac{G}{c^2}\right)^2 M^2
$$ and the black hole entropy is therefore proportional to the mass of the black hole $M$ squared:
$$
S_{BH} = \frac{4 \pi k_B G}{\hbar c} M^2.
$$
But this quite unusual for an entropy. In classical thermodynamics entropy is always supposed to be an extensive quantity, so $S\sim M$. But the black hole entropy $S_{BH} \sim M^2$ is obviously a non-extensive quantity. Isn't a non-extensive entropy inconsistent within the framework of thermodynamics? Why is it, that the entropy of a black hole must be a non-extensive quantity? Shouldn't we better define an entropy for a black hole from e.g. the ratio of Schwarzschild radius to Planck length, which would give us an extensive entropy like
$$
S_{BH, ext} \sim k_B \frac{r_s}{l_P} \sim k_B\sqrt{\frac{4G}{\hbar c}} M

<p>Using a system of beams that rotate along alternating axis' from either end of themselves so as to travel a distance equal to the length of the beams with each rotation, on the surface it seems that by utilizng a beam that is 2000 miles long and a rotor operating at 94 rotations per second we would be able to move a ship faster than the speed of light,</p>

<p>Why wont this work?</p>

<p>My understanding is that an object takes more energy to accelerate as its momentum increases, so the question is would a system such as this be able to operate for even a minute or second, since the system would traverse at the speed of light possibly without accuring SOL momentum. If linear momentum can be made constant so that any forward movement relies on the thruster systems velocity which is well below the SOL, what would be the challenge in achieving such a system of transport?</p>

<p>So if I understood it right, given enough time the system will move through all possible states. 
However, from thermodynamics we know that state of equilibrium is in a sense the ""final state"" in which system will get once and won't move to other states after that. </p>

<p>Aren't these two things in contradiction? If ergodic hypothesis is true then wouldn't that mean that system which is already in state of equilibrium will spontaneously move out of equilibrium into some other state (after enough time has passed)?</p>

<ol>
<li>DOI: 10.1080/104077801300348842</li>
<li>10.1002/(SICI)1097-0207(19990920)46:2&lt;231::AID-NME672>3.0.CO;2-K</li>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WGFQX.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WGFQX.png"" alt=""Dual Hyperbolic Two Temperature Model""></a>
This essentially models the ablation of a thin metal film by a femtosecond laser pulse, $T$ represents temperature (electron and lattice) and $q$ is the heat flux.</p>

<p>I coded the CSPM scheme successfully and tested it through some simple examples (including a simple 1 temperature model in paper <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WGFQX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>). However, for the TTM, the results are <em>close</em> to what I need (i.e. qualitative shape of curves), but they're off. I think it might be the boundary conditions and/or the way I'm assigning particle mass and density.</p>

<p>The boundary conditions I need to use are:
$q_{E, L}(z = 0, t) = q_{E, L}(z = L, t) = 0$ where L is the film length.</p>

<p>My questions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I correctly pick the boundary particle positions? I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A: Boundary particles with their centers on the boundary (z = 0, z = L).</p></li>
<li><p>B: Boundary particles which do not lie on the boundary (z = dz, z = L-dz).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>For both cases, the particles are equally spaced, with $h = dz$ (<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WGFQX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a> recommends this value of $h$). Boundary particle B gives me better results (peak temp. is around 750 compared to expected 650, for example). Particle (A) has worse results (peak 850 vs 650). The boundary particle has half the mass of the internal particles, otherwise, the zigzaging bhavior in the picture below prevails. Curves have the correct shape but they're not smooth. Most SPH papers deal with hydrodynamics and I haven't found an in-depth discussion of how to position my boundary particles, especially that CSPM is slightly different from SPH. I am just enforcing my $q$ boundaries to 0 and not updating them as you would in as mesh-based method.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LaBj7.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LaBj7.png"" alt=""Zigzagging behavior is apparent with certain selections of boundary particles or density/mass definitions""></a></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The bigger issue, how do I define mass and density in this case? Other SPH applications seem to have a physical meaning for both these quantities (and density seems to be involved in the PDEs themselves in most cases), but in my case I have no idea how to define these. Treat the particles as metal atoms and use those values?</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently I'm using:</p>

<p>$m = dz\cdot1\times10^9$ for internal particles, and half that for boundary particles. My $dz$ is in nm, if I use such a small value for mass it just doesn't work.</p>

<p>For density I tried two formulations:
 - Constant rho = 1. Gives best results.
 - Using the equation $\rho_i = \sum_j^N W_{ij}m_j$. Results are zig-zagging as shown above.</p>

<p>Note that in all cases $\sum_j W_{ij} m_j/\rho_j$ is not equal to 1 for the first few particles near the boundary, but is equal to 1 for internal particles. Is this expected?</p>

<p>$$ [x,p]=iℏ.$$ </p>

<p>I have seen at this link (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation</a>) that this means the two operators are fourier transforms of each other.</p>

<h1>1)</h1>

<p>Could someone please point out a good source for more intuition and detailed steps on these canonical conjugate operators, showing their fourier transforms and why they need to satisfy this commutator relationship?</p>

<h1>2)</h1>

<p>Are there any other properties two operators need to satisfy so that they can be shown to be governed by the Uncertainty Principle?</p>

<h1>EDIT:</h1>

<p>Please note, the related question links in other questions that provide proofs for the uncertainty principle. 
But, after having looked at many of the mathematical proofs (some long and many short versions) for the uncertainty principle. It becomes clear that the uncertainty principle is the result of the assumption regarding the relationship between canonical conjugate operators.</p>

<p>Position and Momentum satisfy this relation because of the DeBroglie experiments. But how can this be generalized to a larger set of conjugate operators (as the wikipedia article seems to imply)? Any pointers would be appreciated. </p>

<p>The mathematics is fairly straightfoward (as it usually is when the rules applied are clearly stated) but the reason why conjugate operators need to satify this relation is not clear (As stated on the wikipedia link). </p>

Within the molecule, the hydrogen vibrates in one dimension with respect to the iodine. Pupils are asked to explain that the hydrogen atom (or nucleus) cannot be at rest, using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle written in the form $\Delta x\cdot\Delta p\geq h/(4\pi)$. (The statistical form $\sigma_x\cdot\sigma_p=\geq h/(4\pi)$ isn't part of the curriculum at this level.)</p>

<p>I'm comfortable with one explanation: if H were at rest, then $\Delta p$ would be 0, meaning that $\Delta x$ diverges. But H must remain within the space of the HI molecule (not considering tunneling) so we have a contradiction. It follows that the assumption of H at rest cannot be true. So far, no problem for me.</p>

<p>I'm puzzled by the second explanation in the official text that must be used by teachers like me to judge the pupil's anwers. The text assigns a score point for the ""insight that being at rest means $\Delta x$ and/or $\Delta p$ is 0"". This validates an explanation using ""being at rest means $\Delta x$ is 0"". This doesn't seem true to me. The exam makers have tried to clarify: ""If succesive measurements of the H position produce the same $x$ value, then $\Delta x=0$ and H is at rest. This violates the uncertainty principle""</p>

This is obtained via Newton's second law $F=ma$. $V(x)$ together with an initial condition determines $x(t)$.</p>

<p>The program of quantum mechanics is to obtain the particle's wave function $\Psi(x,t)$, gotten from solving the Schrôdinger equation:</p>

<p>$$i \hbar \frac{∂\Psi}{∂t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{∂^2\Psi}{∂x^2} + V\Psi .$$</p>

"270050","Energy of tides: how does the change of spin of a body affect another body through gravity?","<p>There are a few posts here at PSE that explain how the energy of tides comes at the expense of the Moon/Earth angular momentum.</p>

<p>There is something that escapes me: how can angular momentum or KE be affected by what happens on Earth? How does the Moon know there are tides on Earth? its pull , which is their only relation, is always the same, isn't it? </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>previous  <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/267529/from-where-do-tides-get-their-energy"">answers</a> (you find links therein) just report the generic explanation at wiki or other sites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the moon orbits around the earth much slower than the earth
  rotates, the moon drags water and rock around the earth in the
  direction opposite its rotation. <strong>In this manner</strong> angular <em>momentum and
  energy is transferred from the rotation of the earth</em> into the orbit of
  the moon (and lost to friction in the tides), resulting in the Earth's
  spin slowing and the Moon moving farther away from the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The explanation seems that if the rotation of the Earths slows down (because of the action of the Moon), it affects the angular momentum of the Moon, right? But, if it were an asteroid that cancelled the spin of the Earth, would that upset the orbit of the moon, too?</p>

<p><strong>edit 2</strong> (<em>in response to the vote to close the question</em>)</p>

<p>This question is not a duplicate, and is asking for a real  explanation of an ungrounded assumption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the exact mechanism really matter? One of the big joys of the
  conservation laws is that they let you skirt around details. That
  angular momentum is conserved and that <strong>the Moon is responsible for
  most of the slowing of the Earth's rotation rate</strong> is a good answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is more general, is not referring just to the Moon. I am asking to explain how conservation of momentum can apply to an object that his following its path in the curved spacetime, why if one body changes its spin it must affect other bodies or just the one that is thought to have <em>indirectly</em> caused the change. Is this a bad question?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> (<em>in response to the closure</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I down-voted and voted to close, because <strong>your question is the same</strong> as
  that in the duplicate. It is still overtly referring to the tides and
  the Earth-Moon system.- sammy jerbil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>my question is not the same <em>at all</em>: the answer to the <em>duplicate</em> reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since it is the
  tides that are slowing down the Earth's rotation rate, and since it is
  the Moon and the Sun that are the causes of the tides, that <em>angular
  momentum must be transferring to the Moon</em> and Sun.
  <strong>Does the exact mechanism really matter?</strong> One of the big joys of the
  conservation laws is that they let you <strong>skirt around details</strong>. .. That angular
  <em>momentum is conserved and that the Moon is responsible for most of the
  slowing of the Earth's rotation rate is a good answer.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question was ""<strong><em>How</strong> does angular momentum transfer...</em>"" and the answer says that the <em>the how, the exact mechanism</em> doesn't matter, deails can be <em>skirted</em> and suffice it to say that L <em>must</em> be conserved, and that the Moon must get the same amount of L subtracted to earth.</p>

<p>This did <em>not</em> answer the original question, and my question was a request to give a real answer, to  unveil that <em>superfluous mechanism</em>, which is the purpose of a '<em>how</em> question. If conservation law applied that would be the <em>why</em> and not the <strong>how</strong>. There are valid reasons to suspect, as I showed in my answer, that that explanation is incorrect (sort-of a handwave) and that the appropriateness of  conservation of mechanical L here has to be demonstrated.</p>

<p>This question cannot be off-topic because it was earlier declared a duplicate of a legit question. The remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We deal with mainstream physics here. <em>Questions about the general
  correctness of unpublished personal theories are <strong>off topic</em></strong>,</p>

In particular, I am unsure how to deal with derivatives in the Poisson brackets, especially if there are covariant derivatives involved.

However, the virtual displacements in the $\delta q_{I}$'s may not be consistent with constraints. If there are $n$ variables and $m$ constraint equations $f_\alpha$ of the form Eq.

I hope I won't come across as some misinformed perpetual motion dummy.</p>

<p>Ok, so basically, people are puzzled because of the Universe's highly disordered state shortly after the Big Bang, which was the result of a highly ordered singularity suddenly exploding, resulting in chaos and  tons of other material scattering around. Now, this should logically result in high entropy, but on the other hand, the Universe had unusually <em>low</em> entropy at its beginnings. </p>

<p>Could it be that the disorder present at that time was so disordered that it somehow looped back to ordered once again? After all, high entropy is more than just disorder, it is also a sign that the energy present within an enclosed system is also highly degraded and pretty much unusable and impossible to harness. It would make sense for the energy present at the beginning of the Universe to somehow be conserved within the particles scattered by the Big Bang, therefore allowing its harvest and use for the processes that eventually resulted in the Universe as we know it. I don't really know how such a system could be so disordered it eventually resulted in a triumph of order, but I think the high presence of usable, not-degraded, and conserved energy could be the key to that.</p>

<p>Does this sound in any way plausible? You can maul me if it's wrong, and if this problem has already been solved, well, I apologize for wasting your time.</p>

"270089","Quantum Entanglement Simulation","<p>Suppose there is a digital ""quantum entanglement simulator"" with a pair generator and two spin detectors, and it </p>

<ol>
<li>Allows to create as many pairs as you want (100 pairs per single click)</li>
<li>Allows to measure spin at the detectors in any combination of angles</li>
<li>Allows you to set angle combinations randomly, at any time</li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding is - it must demonstrate below correlations in order to qualify as a successful digital simulator for entanglement - </p>

<ol>
<li>Anti-correlation, when particles of any pairs are measured in same angle, they always have opposite spin</li>
<li>Statistical correlation-1 - If you measure numerous particles at a detector, in a specific angle, the outcome must be ~50% up, ~50% down</li>
<li>Statistical correlation-2 - If you measure numerous pairs at two detector, in two angles A and B, the correlation (both up, or both down) should be SQUARE of sin((A-B)/2) times the total number of pairs measured at this angle combination.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is - Is there any other type of correlation that needs to be implemented?</p>

<p>So far, I've been reading <em>Semiconductor physics and devices</em> by Neamen but he only talks about a certain type of heterojunctions, the <em>straddling</em> ones, and he doesn't analyze what happens with the <em>staggered</em> and <em>broken-gap</em>.

"270093","Why can we approximate massive particles as massless or vice versa?","<p>Our descriptions of massless and massive particles are very different. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Massless particles have only two polarizations, which we call helicities. Spin projection on axes different than that of momentum is not defined. </li>
<li>Yang-Mills fields come equipped with a gauge symmetry group, which would be ruined if we added mass.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when considering processes at energy scales much larger than the rest masses of particles involved, we often treat particles as if they were massless, with good results. How is this possible if the massive and massless cases are so qualitatively different? Is there really a continuous transition between $m=0$ and $m= \epsilon$? If so, how is it reconciled with the facts above?</p>

<hr>

<p>For example, consider the process $\pi^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$. Since the pion mass is much greater than the electron's or neutrino's, we can assume them to be massless. Due to properties of weak interaction, the electron will be left-handed and the neutrino will be right-handed. Since they are massless, chirality is the same as helicity. So, in the center of mass frame, where their momenta are antiparallel, their spins will be parallel. Therefore the total angular momentum is $1$, which is impossible because $\pi^-$ is a pseudoscalar. On the other hand, the $\mu ^-$ is much more massive (mass comparable to that of pion), so this argument doesn't work. Decay to muon is allowed and experimentally verified to be much more probable than decay to electron. </p>

"270097","Homotopy Theory for Topological Insulators","<p>I'm trying to understand topological insulators in terms of homotopy invariants. I understand that in 2 spatial dimensions, we have Chern insulators since $$\pi_2(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$$
One subtlety that I don't get is why it's alright to replace the brillouin-zone, which is a Torus ($T^2$) by a 2-sphere ($S^2$) when calculating this invariant.</p>

<p>Secondly, in 3d, we have that
$$\pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$$
So then why is there no Chern insulator in 3d? I'm assuming this has to do with ""classifying spaces"" so I'd appreciate an answer involving homotopy invariants that clarifies why there is only the trivial insulator in 3d without time-reversal and also why the classification changes to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. </p>

"270103","What is wrong with my formulas for a mathematical model of a double pendulum?","<p>I tried mathematics but I've had no response in a month. I wanted to create a computer simulation on Matlab, using a model for a pendulum from this study (A double pendulum model of tennis strokes. Rod Cross. Uni of Sydney, 2006) - <a href=""http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~cross/PUBLICATIONS/49.%20TennisDPend.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Link</a>
I wanted to use the model from that study specifically, as it uniquely includes the motion of the elbow for various tennis shots, so it's effectively a triple pendulum. I've tried to contact the author and the author of similar studies but to no avail. </p>

<p>Before I created a simulation, I wanted to check I could replicate the results of the study. I inputted the formulas into excel, which I'm more familiar with then Matlab. <a href=""http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iq1EEVaS9KmKIusScJzO5hKExXXuS8Vz7u5QtmIs8VQ/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">Link for spreadsheet</a>.  I tried to replicate the diagrams in Figs 2 and 4, using the equations in the appendix of the study. The shape of my charts matches that of the study, which is encouraging, but the values are too high. </p>

<p>I've read all the references but I'm none the wiser, as they layout the same/similar formulas but don't show a result in the form of a number, that I can use to compare against my own. Changing the numerical method from Forward Euler to RK2/4, or to a much smaller timestep makes very, very little impact. So, I feel that can be ruled out. </p>

<p>The constants such as mass, moment of inertia and gravitational acceleration are all as shown in the study. Icm1/2 and I1/I2 are common formulas for Moment of inertia at different axis, that I know well, so they're definitely right. </p>

<p>I've checked all the formulas on MathPapa and Mathematica. They're all inputted properly. So I think the problem must be with the metric I've used. I used SI, so I've used kg, m, and rads, including for cos and sin. Excel calculates Cos and Sin as an input of rads and an output of rads, but I don't think thats an issue as rads
are the natural units for angular rotation in the SI system.</p>

<p>It's a lot to ask but if anyone is willing to read the study and check my spreadsheet. Or it could be solved using other avenues, like Mathematica etc.l I'll keep checking on here regularly and try and work through it all. The spreadsheet is not far off being right. </p>

"270110","Why is the molecular partition function only broken down into translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic states, ignoring configurations?","<p>Per Atkins and others, energy is the sum of contributions from the translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic modes of motion. Since the formula for the partition function is $Q=\sum_i e^{\beta E_i}$, Q is distributed into these 4 modes.</p>

<p>However, those 4 modes miss many of the $i$ configurations. For example, cyclohexane has boat and chair configurations, as well as many in-between. If I were to use the formulas for the 4 components of the partition function found in Atkins and other textbook, the partition function couldn't possibly include these different configurations.</p>

<p>Also, per my understanding of molecular mechanics, energy (of an ideal gas, using the same assumption used in the molecular partition function) is typically broken down into bonds (vibrations), angles, and dihedrals, as well as other contributions.</p>

"270111","Why $\epsilon_0 = 1/(4\pi k)$ instead of $\epsilon_0 = 4\pi k$?","<p>In my physics book, they consider a positive point charge $q$ and a spherical surface of radius $r$ centered on this positive charge. Then the flux through this surface is given by $$\Phi = \iint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \iint EdA\cos\theta$$
Since $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{A}$ are parallel, $\cos\theta=1$, so the integral become just $$\iint EdA$$ Furthermore, $E$ is constant on every point so you get $$\iint EdA = E \iint dA = E(4\pi r^2)$$ where the last step follows from the fact that the surface is a sphere. Then according to Gauss's law $E=kq/r^2$ we get $$\Phi = \left(\frac{kq}{r^2}\right)(4\pi r^2) = 4\pi kq$$
Then finally they define a new constant $\epsilon_0$ which is equal to $1/(4\pi k)$ so that we get $$\iint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}$$
Now the real question: why is $\epsilon_0 = 1/(4\pi k)$</p>

<p>Why $\epsilon_0 = 1/(4\pi k)$ instead of $\epsilon_0 = 4\pi k$? Why use the inverse (reciprocal)? Whouldn't be $$\iint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = q_{enclosed} \epsilon_0$$ an ""easier"" and better choice?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit: With easier I mean a more logical choice.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I was under the impression that $\epsilon_0$ is defined to make Gauss's law simpler. I voted this question to close.</p>
"
"270115","What Is the Roche Limit Factor for a Tension-Free Solid Rubble Pile?","<p>I have reached a confusion when searching for derivations of the Roche Limit, which differ in value and explanation.</p>

<p>All equations are given of the form:</p>

<p>$ P = r_{M} \sqrt[3]{f\frac{\rho_{M}}{\rho_{S}}} $</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$P$ : Roche Limit</p>

<p>$r_M$ : radius of large body</p>

<p>$\rho_{M}$ : density of the large body</p>

<p>$\rho_{S}$ : density of the small satellite</p>

<p>$f$ : what I am calling the `Roche Factor'</p>

<hr>

<p>My issue is the value of $f$, which seems to vary depending on where one looks. I am interested in its value for a satellite that is a pile of rubble (or sand) with no elasticity or internal tension.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any corrections to my understanding of the justification for the various values, which I will outline below.</p>

<hr>

<p>$f = 2$</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> page, the justification is that, in the accelerating frame of the satellite, there are two opposing forces. There is the tidal force, $F_T$ resulting for the differing field strength across satellite, and there is the gravitational attraction $F_G$ between all the pieces of the satellite.</p>

<p>The derivation states that, for a small particle to remain on the surface of the satellite, $F_G &gt; F_T$.</p>

<p>Here, $f=2$ essentially because there is a 2 in the tidal force equation.</p>

<p>Note: I haven't seen it mentioned, but although $g$ diminishes linearly inside the satellite, the tidal force will also diminish by the same factor. Hence, passing the Roche limit will cause the whole rubble pile to disintegrate simultaneously, not stating from the outer edge as one might presume.</p>

<hr>

<p>$f = 3$</p>

<p>As above, but an extra term is included since moons are not only in free-fall but also will be rotating upon their own axes.</p>

<p>In the accelerating frame of a particle on the surface of the satellite, there will also be a centrifugal force $F_C$, outwards from the centre of the satellite. If the satellite is tidally locked, then $F_C$ will always point towards the large body. Hence $F_G &gt; F_T + F_C$. Seemingly coincidentally, $F_C = \frac{1}{2}F_T$, giving $f=3$</p>

<p>A rotating body will be more fragile due to the centrifugal forces, and hence its Roche limit occurs further from the large body.</p>

<hr>

<p>$f = 16$</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jgiesen.de/astro/stars/roche.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">For example</a></p>

<p>Instead of considering a small mass on the surface of the satellite, these derivations touch together two spheres of equal radii and mass, and then find the distance where $F_G &gt; F_T$. Since the distance separating the centres of the two spheres is $2r$, this produces an extra factor of 2 in the tidal force, and an extra factor of $\frac{1}{2^2}$ in the gravitational force. Hence, $f=2\times2\times2^2=16$.</p>

<p>This seems an arbitrary and probably incorrect derivation that is attempting to ape the value that Roche derived (below).</p>

<hr>

<p>$f = 2.2423^3$ or = $2.2455^3$</p>

<p>Again from the Wikipedia page, it seems that these values are the limit when the pieces of rubble in the satellite become infinitesimal small. When the rubble is large, is stays approximately circular until its Roche limit. When the rubble is very small, the tidal force causes the satellite to become an ellipsoid well before the Roche limit. The values of f in this case cannot be obtained algebraically.</p>

<p>The former value was obtained by Roche, but does not consider centrifugal force due to axial rotation, which the latter values corrects.</p>

<hr>

<p>So how does one choose the correct value?</p>

<p>It seems that $f=2$ is more applicable to incoming projectiles that are rubble piles (such as Shoemaker-Levy 9 striking Jupiter). </p>

<p>Whereas $f=3$ is better when providing limits for rubble pile moons (but is this contradicted by the fact that Phobos and Saturn's inner moons are said to be inside their Roche limits?).</p>

<p>$f = 2.2455^3$ is useful for explaining orbits that arose during the birth of the solar system, when everything was liquid, however these objects have since acquired tensions from the solid rock and now $f$ is far lower. So they could now inhabit regions that were prohibited during their formation.</p>

$$
0=q_{\text{in}}-q_{\text{out}}= q_{x} - (\mathrm{d}q_{\text{conv}} + q_{x+\mathrm{d}x})

introducing the adimensional lenght $X$, we obtain for every function $f(x)=f(LX)=f(X)$, including any differential relation:
$$
X \overset{\Delta}{=} x/L\to x=LX\quad\text{therefore}\quad\mathrm{d}X=\mathrm{d}x/L\to\mathrm{d}x=L\mathrm{d}X
$$
So, four new functions are defined, where $\bar h$ is the averaged convection heat transfer coefficient on $X$. In the following list, all of the uppercase roman new functions are adimensional:
$$
\theta(X) \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{T(X) - T_{∞}}{T_{b} - T_{∞}}\quad K(X) \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{A(X)}{A_{0}} \quad p(X) \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{\mathrm{d}S(X)}{\mathrm{d}X}

$$
W(X) \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{h(X)}{p_{0}\bar h}\frac{\mathrm{d}S(X)}{\mathrm{d}X} = \frac{h(X)}{\bar h}\frac{p(X)}{p(0)}
$$
Then two constants are introduced (uppercase is adimensional):
$$
m = \frac{\bar h p(0)}{kA_0}\quad M = mL
$$
Substituting into $(5)$ and rearranging we obtain the adimensional differential relation:
$$
\begin{align}
h(X)\frac{\mathrm{d}S(X)}{\mathrm{d}x}[T(X)-T_\infty] &amp;= k\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[A(X)\frac{\mathrm{d}T(X)}{\mathrm{d}x}]\\[5pt]

I know about a product called shark shield which uses magnetism to overload the ampuli of Lorenzini in a sharks nose area.
While working with some electromagnets on some RV trailer brakes today, I wondered if I could attach a 9vdc battery to one of the magnets and loop a piece of wire through the center to create a protective shield around me when I dive. Since I've never taken a physics class, I figured I'd ask a few who understand this better than I. I know I know, I should just buy the $700 product they already make, but I'm curious.    </p>

"270123","Lightning, Electrical breakdown, and Current","<p>Recently a discussion came up about this gif: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/r9Q8M4G.gifv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/r9Q8M4G.gifv</a></p>

<p>This lead to a few questions about electrical breakdown of insulators. The disagreement we're having is whether or not a current is present before a lightning strike occurs. I personally don't think there is any measurable current between the clouds and the ground prior to the electrical breakdown of the air, but other disagree with me. Others went as far as to say that there <em>needs</em> to be a current for lightning to happen. Considering that you don't need a current to polarize a dielectric, that sounds totally wrong to me, although the amount of disagreement I'm receiving has caused me to second guess myself. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I can't give any more context to this without posting individual comments, so to sum about the question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a current between the air and ground prior to a lightning strike, or is the potential difference solely responsible for the electrical breakdown and discharge?</li>

"270125","Do III-V based photovoltaics ""glow"" (photo-luminesce) when illuminated but not loaded?","<p>In <a href=""http://space.stackexchange.com/a/17509/12102"">this nice answer</a> I started to learn about how the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Truss_Structure#Solar_arrays"" rel=""nofollow"">silicon photovoltaics cells on the International Space Station</a> are managed. In that case, the cells are generally either delivering useful power to the station, or shunted to a dummy load. However, some satellites may leave some fraction of their photovoltaics open circuit if there is low power demand. In that case, the electron-hole pairs produced by sunlight are left to recombine within the junction itself.</p>

<p>Does this mean that photovoltaic cells made from III-V compounds with direct band gaps would produce measurable amounts of photoluminesence under solar illumination, at a wavelength roughly corresponding to the local band gap - there might be heterostructures so the wavelength may not correspond to bulk material band gap.</p>

<p>InP (in the past), InGaAs and GaAs based semiconductor junctions are often used. Many high power telecommunications satellites in geostationary orbits use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-junction_solar_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">multi-junction cells</a> that are made from GaAs based semiconductor materials. If I pointed a (near IR capable) telescope at one (for example using <a href=""http://space.stackexchange.com/a/12409/12102"">this clever technique</a>), and used a filter, could I detect this luminescence?</p>

<p>I understand why in general relativity there should be no effect. The electromagnetic field strength tensor is a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor. Write it using covariant derivatives:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}F_{\mu \nu}&amp;=\partial_\mu A_\nu - \Gamma^\sigma_{\mu \nu} A_\sigma - \partial_\nu A_\mu + \Gamma^\sigma_{\nu \mu} A_\sigma\\&amp;=\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu\end{align*}$$
For a torsion-free connection, the connection is symmetric for the two lower indices. All terms from the metric drop out no matter if space-time is flat or curved.</p>

<p>I am interested in the experimental conformation because I work on an approach to physics that does not use tangent spaces, metric tensors, and connections. Instead the 4D manifold is given the power to multiply and divide other elements in the manifold instead of being passive anchor points for tangent spaces. My efforts indicate that the $E$ field still does not change its value at different heights in a gravitational field. For my proposal, the same cannot be said for the magnetic field which is predicted to change on the order of $B \rightarrow B'=B(1 + 4 G M/c^2 dh)$. A magnetic field quantifies electric charges in motion relative to an observer. Motion is always effected by gravity. It may be reasonable to hope to see the electric field unaltered, but the magnetic field changed by gravity. Such a test would be a deep technical challenge if done on Earth, needing a measurement of $B$ to one part in $10^{14}$ if done over a difference of a hundred meters on Earth.</p>

"270132","Applying Ampere's Law for Two Parallel Wires","<p>This seems a simple question but I'm not able to understand it properly. Say we have two parallel wires carrying same current I in different directions. We need to calculate the magnetic field at any point on the wires plane (not between the wires).</p>

<p>We know that the magnetic field (H) from one wire is I/2*pi*r where r is the distance from the wire. We can then use superposition to find the total magnetic field from both wires. The magnetic fields will tend to cancel each other but the net field will NOT be zero because the wires are not at the same distance from the test point.</p>

<p>Now, if we try to apply Ampere's law along a circular path that encloses both wires, the magnetic field will equal to zero since the current passing through the enclosed surface is zero (since both currents are equal but in opposite directions). Why does this method give us a different answer?</p>

"270145","Universe spawned from the death of a hyper black hole?","<p>Some Cosmologists have speculated that the Universe formed from the debris ejected when a four-dimensional star collapsed into a black hole a scenario that would help to explain why the cosmos seems to be so uniform in all directions.</p>

<p>It is also difficult to explain how a violent Big Bang would have left behind a Universe that has an almost completely uniform temperature, because there does not seem to have been enough time since the birth of the cosmos for it to have reached temperature equilibrium.</p>

<p>if the bulk universe contained its own four-dimensional (4D) stars, some of them could collapse, forming 4D black holes in the same way that massive stars in our Universe do: they explode as supernovae, violently ejecting their outer layers, while their inner layers collapse into a black hole.</p>

<p>In our Universe, a black hole is bounded by a spherical surface called an event horizon. Whereas in ordinary three-dimensional space it takes a two-dimensional object (a surface) to create a boundary inside a black hole, in the bulk universe the event horizon of a 4D black hole would be a 3D object — a shape called a hypersphere.</p>

<p>When Cosmologists modeled the death of a 4D star, they found that the ejected material would form a 3D brane surrounding that 3D event horizon, and slowly expand.</p>

<p>The 3D Universe we live in might be just such a brane — and that we detect the brane’s growth as cosmic expansion. “Astronomers measured that expansion and extrapolated back that the Universe must have begun with a Big Bang.</p>

<p>The models also naturally explains our Universe’s uniformity. Because the 4D bulk universe could have existed for an infinitely long time in the past, there would have been ample opportunity for different parts of the 4D bulk to reach an equilibrium, which our 3D Universe would have inherited.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One typical definition of torsion is 
\begin{align}
T(X,Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X,Y]

with this one can say torsion 
\begin{align}
T_{MN}{}^K = 2 \Gamma_{[MN]}{}^K = \Gamma_{MN}{}^K - \Gamma_{NM}{}^K
\end{align}
and demand that $T_{MN}{}^K=0$, we have symmetrized $\Gamma$ for first two indices (In above notation). </p>

<p>I can re-write this as 
\begin{align}
[X,Y](\partial) = [X,Y](\nabla)
\end{align}
where $[X,Y]$ are usual Lie bracket.</p></li>
<li><p>In Physics, focusing on general relativity, they consider torsion-less connection from the beginning. In some textbook, states via geodesic equation 
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda = \frac{\partial x^\lambda}{\partial \xi^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \xi^\alpha}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\nu}
\end{align}
or other textbook states in terms of orthonormal basis 
\begin{align}
\nabla_{e_i} e_j = \nabla_{e_j} e_i = \Gamma_{ij}{}^k e_k
\end{align}
Above two connections imply torsion-less in its definition. (Of course, one can distinguish $\nabla_{e_i} e_j$ and $\nabla_{e_j} e_i$. $i.e$, One can define torsion as a subtraction between them. )</p></li>
<li><p>Or some textbook as Carroll, defines torsion as a commutation relation from covariant derivatives $i.e$, 
\begin{align}
[\nabla_A, \nabla_B] V_K = - R_{MNK}{}^L V_L - T_{MN}{}^K \nabla_L V_K
\end{align}
apparently, with some computation we see that 
\begin{align}
T_{MN}{}^K = 2 \Gamma_{[MN]}{}^K
\end{align}
which agrees with first statement. </p></li>
<li><p>Or one can deduce this from 
\begin{align}
L_X(\partial) = L_X(\nabla)
\end{align}
where $L_X$ is a Lie-deriative along $X$ direction.  Applying for $V_K$ we have $\Gamma_{MN}{}^K = \Gamma_{NM}{}^K$ </p></li>

<p>This is a hollow metallic cylinder with a small metallic rod inside. The rod is connected to the bottom of the cylinder but is a bit shorter than the outer cylinder. It is some type of coaxial cavity. The larger radius is $r_c$, the length is $l$, the rod has radius $r_r$ and length $ l-d$. What I want to do now is to solve the wave equation in this domain. I don't know whether it is possible to analytically do that, but I read in an IEEE paper that it should work.</p>

<p>To solve my problem, I first took the scalar Helmholtz equation
$$
\frac{1}{\varrho} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial \varrho} \left( \varrho \, \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \varrho} \right)
+ \frac{1}{\varrho^2}\,\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \varphi^2} + \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2} + k^2\,\psi = 0
$$
and tried it to separate as follows:
$$
\psi = R(\varrho) \, \Phi(\varphi) \, Z(z)
$$
I am now interested on the z component of the electric field. The boundary conditions are: the z component must vanish at the outer wall of the cylinder from $z = 0$ to $z = l$, and it must also vanish at the inner wall from $z = 0$ to $z = l-d$.
Using above separation, one finds the three ODEs
$$
Z'' + k_z^2\,Z = 0
$$
and
$$
\Phi'' + n^2\,\Phi = 0
$$
and
$$
\varrho^2\,R'' + \varrho\,R' + R \left( \varrho^2\,a^2 - n^2 \right) = 0
$$
and I do know that I need the Bessel function of the first kind to solve the last ODE. However, I don't know what to do with the boundary conditions because I have two different ranges for z, where psi must vanish. How can I proceed?</p>

<p>The values of the temperature and speed are coming from a local weather station. The power-losses are through thermal conduction, radiation and forced convection.</p>

<p>The metal plate heater should be placed like this: ====#####====</p>

<li>at # is the heated part of the plate</li>
<li>= is the unheated plate</li>

$$\Phi=\lambda\times A_{profile}\times\frac{T_{heater}-T_{air}}{l_{unheated}}$$</p>

<p>The thermal radiation (the surface of the air is much larger than the plates one):
$$\varPhi=\varepsilon\times\sigma\times (A_{upside}+2\times A_{side})\times\left(T_{heater}^{4}-T_{air}^{4}\right)$$</p>

Rotary engine is able to rotate the boat at a place with maximum angular speed $\omega$ rad/s and achieves that speed at acceleration rate $\epsilon$ rad/s². Corresponding angular deceleration is $\epsilon'$ rad/s².

Thus, the ground state energy of this can be written as $E = E^{(0)}+E^{(1)}+\ldots$ where $E^{(0)}=\langle F|\mathcal{A}|F\rangle$ for the ground state $\vert F\rangle$ of $\mathcal{A}$, which is the Fermi sea, momenta filled up to $p_F = \hbar k_F$.</p>

<p>We wish to compute both $\langle F|\mathcal{A}|F\rangle$ and $E^{(1)}=\langle F|\mathcal{B}|F\rangle$. First, we need to determine $k_F$. We do this by looking at the expectation value of the number operator (in out limit, we replace sums over $\vec{k}$ by integrals times a factor).</p>

<p>And now my confusion begins. In the following calculation, I have sort of a handwavy argument for going from $(\star)$ to $(\star\star)$, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.
\begin{align*}
N = \langle F|\hat{N}|F\rangle&amp;=\frac{V}{(2\pi)^3}\sum_\alpha\int\mathrm{d}^3k\langle F|\hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}^\dagger \hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}^{\phantom{\dagger}} |F\rangle\\[1em]
&amp;=\frac{V}{4\pi^3}\int\mathrm{d}^3k\langle F|\hat{a}_{\vec{k}}^\dagger \hat{a}_{\vec{k}}^{\phantom{\dagger}} |F\rangle \tag{$\star$}\\[1em]
&amp;=\frac{V}{4\pi^3}\int\mathrm{d}^3k \,\Theta(k_F - k)\tag{$\star\star$} \\[1em]
&amp;=\frac{Vk_F^3}{3\pi^2}
\end{align*}
Basically, we're saying we have the Fermi sea, so there are no particles of momenta above $k_F$, i.e. the integrand should vanish (we'd then say the integral is zero, because constants are either 0 or 1 in physics). So we need the step function accounting for that. </p>

<p>But I actually don't understand what $\hat{a}_\vec{k}\vert F\rangle$ is. I don't see what happens when we annihilate this particular ground state. Well, it can't be zero, can it?</p>

<p>And now, while writing this, I realized that we must have
$$
\vert F\rangle = \sum_\alpha \int \text{d}^3k\, \Theta(k_F - k) \hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}^\dagger |0\rangle,
$$
right? Because then we can easily calculate
\begin{align*}
\hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}|F\rangle = \Theta(k_F-k)\vert 0\rangle\implies\langle F|\hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}^\dagger \hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}^{\phantom{\dagger}} |F\rangle=\lVert \hat{a}_{\vec{k},\alpha}|F\rangle\rVert^2=\Theta(k_F-k),
\end{align*}
and thus the transition from $(\star)$ to $(\star\star)$ is explained.</p>

<p>But this wasn't everything by far. As mentioned above, we want to compute the expectation values of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ in the Fermi sea, using the fact that $k_F\approx 1.92\cdot r_0^{-1}$. The results should be
\begin{align*}
\tag{$R\mathcal{A}$}\frac{2.21}{2} \frac{N e^2}{a_0 r_s}\\[1em]
\tag{$R\mathcal{B}$}-\frac{0.916}{2}\frac{N e^2}{a_0 r_s}.
\end{align*}
My problem is now that I can't even derive the first one, $(R\mathcal{A})$. This is what I did:
\begin{align*}
E^{(0)} &amp;=\frac{V}{8 \pi^3}\frac{e^2}{a_0 r_s^2}\frac{1}{2}\sum_\alpha\int \text{d}^3 k\, k^2 \Theta(k_F-k)\\[1em]
&amp;= \frac{V}{2 \pi^2}\frac{e^2}{a_0 r_s^2}\int_0^{k_F} \text{d}k\,k^4\\[1em]
&amp;= \frac{V}{2 \pi^2}\frac{e^2}{a_0 r_s^2}\frac{k_F^5}{5}\\[1em]
&amp;= \frac{1.92^5}{10 \pi^2}\frac{V e^2}{a_0 r_s^2}r_0^{-5} = \frac{1.92^5}{10 \pi^2}\frac{V e^2}{a_0 r_s^2r_0^2}\frac{4\pi N}{3V}\\[1em]
&amp;= \frac{2\cdot 1.92^5}{15 \pi}\frac{N e^2}{a_0 r_s^2r_0^2}\\[1em]
&amp;\approx \frac{2.21}{2}\frac{N e^2}{a_0 r_s^2r_0^2}.
\end{align*}
This is obviously not the same as $(R\mathcal{A})$, since $r_s r_0^2 = {}^{r_0^3}/_{a_0}\neq 1$.</p>

<p>And if that's wrong I don't even dare try my hand at $(R\mathcal{B})$, so:
What did I do wrong/not understand correctly?</p>

"270200","Conformal group in 2D being a subgroup of Diff x Weyl - Polchinksi's 'String Theory'","<p>I am trying to understand how the conformal group in two dimensions is a subgroup of the direct product of the diffeomorphism group and the group of Weyl transformations, as explained by Polchinski in 'String Theory', Volume 1. </p>

<p>Now, in the appendix on page 364 of the book, Polchinski defines the conformal group (Conf) in two dimensions to be the set of all holomorphic maps. On page 85, the aforementioned explanation is given as to how Conf is a subgroup of the direct product of the diffeomorphism group (diff) and the group of Weyl transformations (Weyl), denoted as (diff $\times$ Weyl) (here, diffeomorphisms refer to general coordinate transformations, and Weyl transformations are point-dependent rescalings of the metric). </p>

<p>This is what I understand from his explanation so far. Conf is a subgroup of diff, since 
we can choose the transformation function, $f$ to be holomorphic ($f(z)$). 
This transforms the flat metric ($ds^2=dz d\overline{z}$) as in equation (2.4.10) of Polchinski, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
ds'^2=dz'd\overline{z}'=\frac{\partial z'}{\partial z}\frac{\partial \overline{z}'}{\partial \overline{z}}dz d\overline{z},
\end{equation}
where $z'=f(z)$. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there are Weyl transformations which can be used to effect the <em>same</em> transformation given above, i.e., we rescale the flat metric $ds^2=dz d\overline{z}$ by $e^{2\omega}$, where</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\omega=\textrm{ln}|\partial_zf|,
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
ds'^2&amp;=e^{2\omega}dz d\overline{z}\\
&amp;=e^{2 \textrm{ln}|\partial_zf|}dz d\overline{z}\\
&amp;=|\partial_zf|^2dz d\overline{z}\\
&amp;=\frac{\partial z'}{\partial z}\frac{\partial \overline{z}'}{\partial \overline{z}}dz d\overline{z},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which is the same as the first equation above. </p>

<p>Now, naively understanding this to imply that conf is a subgroup of Weyl, we arrive at the claim, which is conf is a subgroup of diff $\times$ Weyl, which is what we wanted to show. However, (as noted in the comments below) the conformal group cannot be a subgroup of Weyl, since the transformations compose differently. So how can we say that conf is a subgroup of diff $\times$ Weyl?</p>

<p>Addendum: It cannot be true that conf in this case is a subgroup of diff $\times$ Weyl as a trivial extension of conf being a subgroup of diff, since nontrivial Weyl transformations were used by Polchinski in his proof.</p>

<p>Moreover, on page 542 of Nakahara's 'Geometry, Topology and Physics', it is explained that the the conformal Killing vectors which generate conformal transformations are identified with the <em>overlap</em> between diff and Weyl. They also show this by choosing a specific form for the Weyl function, $\omega$.</p>

"270202","Scalar fields and general coordinate transformations","<p>In classical mechanics, a scalar field is characterised by the fact that its value at a particular point must be invariant under rotations and reflections of coordinates. That is, one requires that $\phi'(x')=\phi(x)$, where a point, $x'$ in the new coordinate system could be related to a point, $x$ in the old one by either a rotation, $x'=Rx$ (where $R$ is a rotation matrix), or a reflection, $x'=-x$.</p>

<p>Then, in special relativity, one requires that a scalar field must be invariant under <em>Poincaré</em> transformations, i.e. under Lorentz transformations and space-time translations, $x'=\Lambda x+a$, such that $\phi'(\Lambda x+a)=\phi(x)$.</p>

<p>However, when one considers general relativity one is confronted with more general coordinate transformations. In this case, how does a scalar field transform under <em>general</em> coordinate transformations? Does one still require that it transforms trivially, i.e. such that $\phi'(x')=\phi(x)$?</p>

"270203","Existence of effective Hamiltonian for variational ansatz","<p>I recently saw on <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> that in perturbation theory one can define in a systematic way effective Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\rm eff}$ that produces the same kind of states and energies as if one applied perturbative expansion to the quantum states and energies (I don't how exactly it works, but maybe someone can explain). I wonder if similar thing could be possible when we have some variational ansatz for the wavefunction. Let's say that this is the state $|\tilde{\psi} \rangle$ of some specific form that is not the solution of stationary Schrodinger equation
$$\hat{H}|\tilde{\psi}\rangle \neq E |\tilde{\psi}\rangle$$
but there might exist some different Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\rm eff}$ that will actually generate state of the assumed form 
$$\hat{H}_{\rm eff}|\tilde{\psi}\rangle = \tilde{E}|\tilde{\psi}\rangle$$</p>

<p>As for the equilibrium, the the stationary EM field and energy flow is clear (see the picture above) (<a href=""http://amasci.com/elect/poynt/poynt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">{1}</a>,<a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/247905/124496"">{2}</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector"" rel=""nofollow"">{3}</a>). There are static electric and magnetic fields with the Poynting vector $\vec S = \vec E \times \vec B$ lines going from the power source to the resistor and showing the direction of the <strong>energy transfer from the source to the resistor</strong> (consumer of energy).</p>

<p>The <strong>four questions</strong> are about physics of <strong>transition from Moment 1 Switching on to Moment 2 Equilibrium</strong>:</p>

<hr>

<p>1)  How many times initial pulse is <strong>reflected back and forth</strong> before the <strong>equilibrium is reached</strong>?<br>
Obviously the answer depends on how ones fixes the Moment 2 Equilibrium:say, the current inside the wire is 90% of equilibrium value ($90\%  \cdot {V \over R}$).  </p>

<hr>

<p>2)  What physical <strong>processes lie behind this “reflection”</strong> (describe the mechanism of “reflection”)?    </p>

<hr>

<p>3)  <strong>Inside what medium</strong> (free space or wires) does the pulse propagate? Its trajectory.  </p>

<p>I am nearly sure (but not 100%) that propagation of the pulse is <strong>happening in the free space surrounding circuit elements</strong>, not inside wires, resistor or power source. Please, confirm or disprove.  </p>

<hr>

<p>4)  What happens <strong>inside the circuit after switching on</strong>?<br>
Namely: 
Are there are <strong>any “electronic” (matter) or EM (field) waves inside the conductor</strong> carrying the energy or “information” that the circuit was switched on?<br>
The question is about the transient processes between Moments 1 and 2.<br>
If yes, what is the propagation speed of these waves? Is it a wave inside an “electron gas” similar to a sound wave? If yes, what are physical processes behind the transfer of energy inside such an electron “gas”?<br>
Or if it is a propagation of EM waves inside the conductor, what is the propagation speed? Should such a wave be immediately absorbed in the conductors (given abundance of free electrons inside)? </p>

<p>Keep in mind, the phase velocity of light inside copper is on the order of several <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect#Formula"" rel=""nofollow"">hundreds meters</a> per second.</p>

<hr>

<p>PS: Since there are a lot of questions, <strong>partial answers are welcome</strong>.<br>
PPS: This is a not well-designed circuit. So reflections do occur.</p>

"270263","Does infalling matter ever cross the event horizon?","<p>Assume you are immortal, then say if you fell towards a blackhole,
 to an observer far away you will appear to slow down as you approach event horizon and gradually come to stand still.</p>

<p>However for you, your time flow will appear normal and never stopped.</p>

<p>Now as we know that there cannot be two different times in the fabric of spacetime , its same time flowing slower near heavier objects than away from them.</p>

<p>In other words you'll have some very real time flow difference like your 1 second = years for far away observer.</p>

<p>Now as you fall towards blackhole you should see the rest of the universe speeding up like a fast forwarded video tape (ignore lack of actual vision due to light bending and other things). By this logic when you hit the event horizon the universe's time would be going infinitely faster and hence the blackhole would have evaporated by that time and universe would end before you cross the event horizon.</p>

"270266","Why do quantum gates have to be reversible?","<p>One possible reason I have come up with is that we are modeling quantum gates by unitary matrices.

This is simply done by ""remembering"" which state has gone in and provide it as output if the reverse operation should be applied.</p>

"270274","Work as force * distance -- what about mass?","<p>So, in defining work as force * distance, how is mass applied?  Is it just that it's $1kg$ multiplied in normally, but that's typically ignored / not shown?  </p>

<p>..so:</p>

<p>$2kg \cdot 1n \cdot 1m$ = $2J$</p>

<p>..or is the answer for $2kg$ still somehow $1J$, and I'm missing something?</p>

<p>@knzhou points out that mass is irrelevant -- however, it took me a while (and a different conversation) to sort out why.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: In retrospect, the question would probably have been better phrased as *""Why isn't mass relevant in calculating work?""</p>

<p>The thought experiment I had in my head was this:  </p>

<p>Two bricks, a 1kg brick and a 2kg brick, are floating in space.  A 1N force is applied to each one until it moves 1 meter.  It takes longer for the 2kg brick to reach this point, and I was thinking that since the force was applied for a longer time, it amounted to an increase in kinetic energy (and thus it must have recieved more work than the 1kg brick).  However, this isn't the case -- it has more momentum, but the work received is the same, reflected in that the 2kg brick has a lower velocity after having travelled the meter.</p>

<p>In the end, I was conflating work and momentum, and overlooking the final velocity of each brick.  Thanks for the answers, and I apologize that my question wasn't well-structured.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jupiter's Great Red Spot - a hurricane three times bigger than Earth - is blasting the planet's upper atmosphere with heat, astronomers have found.
  Using measurements from an infrared telescope in Hawaii, a UK and US team found evidence for temperatures as high as 1,500C - hundreds of degrees warmer than anywhere else on the planet.</p>
  
  <p>They suggest the hotspot is created by thunderous soundwaves ""breaking"" in the thin upper reaches of the atmosphere.</p>
  
  <p>It arguably solves what planetary scientists had dubbed an ""energy crisis"" for gas giants like Jupiter: temperatures in their upper atmospheres soar much higher than can be explained by solar energy - especially given their vast distances from the Sun.</p>

The reason is not currently well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia Solar Corona</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines. The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top. </p>

"270289","Are Newton's laws invalid in real life?","<p>One of my friends and I had an argument over this topic. He stressed the fact that in real life many forces exist, whereas in physics we deal only with ideal situations. He put the following arguments:- </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Newton's First Law is invalid because friction exists in real life.</li>
  <li>Newton's second law is invalid due to the same reasons. </li>
  <li>Newton's third law is invalid because in a trampoline, there is excessive reaction.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In defence, I put forward the following arguments:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Newton's laws are true but the equations have to be modified to take into account the other forces in real life. </p>
  
  <p>For example, if a force $F$ is applied on a body of mass $m$, and $f_s$ is the force of friction, then, the equation becomes $F - f_s = ma$. Thus, we have just modified the equation $F = ma$. </p>
  
  <p>So basically I mean to say that we have to adjust the laws to suit our purpose. </p>

"270295","Why is energy minimized over the string landscape?","<p>As understand it, the 4D string landscape is a function that assigns an energy to every possible compactification of the 6 small spatial dimensions.  We expect our universe to lie in a local energy minimum, and if there is a lower minimum at another compactification, then our universe would only be metastable, because we expect that it would eventually quantum tunnel into the lower minimum.</p>

<p>What is the process that prefers compactifications with lower energy?  I can understand why we might expect total energy should be <em>conserved</em>, but not why it should be <em>minimized</em>.  To me, the logical statistical ensemble with which to describe the universe would be the microcanonical ensemble, in which the total energy is arbitrary and not necessarily minimized.</p>

<p>Usually there are two processes that cause a system to lower its energy: (1) a dissipative system (e.g. one with friction or air resistance) continuously loses energy into an external sink, or (2) a system in thermal equilibrium at zero temperature minimizes its energy because it is coupled to a much larger external heat bath which gains so much entropy from its energy that the total entropy is maximized when all the energy leaves the system and goes into the bath.  In both cases, the idea is that the entropically favored situation is the one in which all the energy leaves the system and goes into some external ""environment.""  But by definition, the universe cannot be coupled to any external environment, so there is nowhere outside of the universe for the energy to go.  So why do we expect low-energy configurations to be any more likely than high-energy ones?</p>

So, it means that the positions of the particles are quite well defined. And according to the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the momenta of two particles are not well defined. The last means that wavefunctions being represented in momentum space have very very very large width of the corresponding Gaussians. And in momentum space they are definitely overlapped.
Two wavefunctions, being overlapped, interact with each other. So scattering event in momentum space should take place, even if in the real space they are not overlapped. If there is scattering event in the momentum space, then it means that momenta of two particles were affected, which implies in turn that something should change in the motion of the particles in the real space. Am I right? It means in turn that particles can scatter from each other even they ""don't touch"" each other... Where am I, if I am, wrong in my thinking flow?</p>

<p>It skips over some details like:</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>How do you mathematically show that momentum must also be transformed by $\gamma$? I kind of get that if both $t$ and $x$ are transformed by the same constant then $v$ cannot be transformed. So it must be the mass of the particle. But what exactly is the reasoning behind also using the Lorentz transform? Also, what does momentum look like in $R$ and $R'$? Is it seen as increasing in both reference frames?</li>
<li>Why does the transformation only occur for parallel motion? The Galilean transformation for perpendicular motion should be $x' = \sqrt{x^2 - (vt)^2}$ and $x = \sqrt{x'^2 + (vt')^2}$ (I think). This disagrees with $x=ct$ and $x' = ct'$ so shouldn't the transformation also occur for objects moving along perpendicular lines?

F_{ij}=\frac{1}{2h^3}\epsilon_{abc}h_a\frac{\partial h_b}{\partial k_i}\frac{\partial h_c}{\partial k_j}

"270347","Does angular momentum of hydrogen atom imply motion of electron around the nucleus?","<p>Does the non-zero orbital angular momentum (or z-component of angular momentum) of a stationary state of hydrogen atom imply motion of electron (or at least the probability density $|\Psi|^2$) around the nucleus?
<p>I really don't know how to start this but:
<br>the expectation value for velocity of a particle can be derived from
$$\frac{d\langle x \rangle}{dt} = \int x \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\Psi|^2dx \tag{1}$$
and applying some integration by parts and some substitution of the time-dependent schrodinger equation (as shown in Griffiths book of QM), we will have</p>

<p>\begin{equation}\frac{d\langle x \rangle}{dt} = -\frac{i\hbar}{m}\int \Psi^*\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}dx \tag{2}\end{equation}</p>

<p>and the expectation value for momentum is just
\begin{equation}\langle p_x\rangle = m\frac{d\langle x\rangle}{dt} = -i\hbar\int \Psi^*\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}dx \tag{3}\end{equation}
so that in applying the momentum operator $p_x = -i\hbar\partial/\partial x$, we are just getting values for the expectation value of momentum.
<br>However, the operator for the z-component of angular momentum reads 
\begin{equation}L_z = -i\hbar(x\partial/\partial y - y\partial/\partial x) = xp_y - yp_x \tag{4}\end{equation}
But for a stationary state of a hydrogen atom, $|\Psi|^2$ is not time-dependent, because
\begin{equation}|\Psi|^2 = \Psi^*\Psi = \psi^* e^{iE_nt/\hbar}\psi e^{-iE_nt/\hbar} = \psi^* \psi \tag{5}\end{equation}
and the tacked time dependence factor cancels out (This does not occur if the wave-function is a superposition of states, because the tacked time-dependence factor does not necessarily cancel out because of difference in energies). Which also means the ""electron cloud (Probability density)"" is not moving/changing, in contradiction to what others say that the motion of the electron cloud and not the electron itself is the reason for the presence of angular momentum - because not even the electron cloud is changing.
<p> And it is also contradictory for me that the z-component of angular momentum should be present, since it involves momentum operators and if you look at equation 1 from which the momentum operator is derived, $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\Psi|^2 = 0$ if $|\Psi|^2$ is not time dependent, which means $\frac{d\langle x \rangle}{dt} = 0$, $\langle p_x\rangle = m\frac{d\langle x\rangle}{dt} = 0$, and if I am correct, applying $p_x = -i\hbar\partial/\partial x$ should yield $0$? </p>

<p>Given a classical field $\phi : \mathbb{R}^{1,3}\to V$ where $V$ carries a finite-dimensional irreducible representation $\rho : P\to\mathrm{GL}(V)$  (e.g. spinor, vector, (p,q)-tensor) and the irreducible <em>unitary</em> representation $U : P\to \mathrm{U}(H)$ where $H$ is the space of one-particle states associated to the field, the Wightman axioms impose that
$$ \rho(\Lambda,a)\phi(\Lambda^{-1}x+a) = U(\Lambda,a)\phi(x)U(\Lambda,a)^\dagger$$
holds as an operator equation on the space of states.</p>

<p>Does this equation uniquely determine $U$ given $\rho$? If yes, how? If no, how do we know which one to choose? If this does not work for arbitrary fields, is there at least a recipe for free fields?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll now describe what thoughts I have so far:</p>

<p>For the massive case I believe the answer is ""natural"": By Mackey's theory of induced representations, the unitary irreducible representations of $P$ are given by choosing an element of $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^4$ and a unitary irreducible representation of the stabilizer of $\alpha$ in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ together with a unitary character $\mathbb{R}^4\to\mathrm{U}(1)$, which I think is usually just 1 in physics. The stabilizer is known as the ""little group"" leaving the momentum of a particle in its rest frame invariant. For massive particles, this is $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and since the finite-dimensional representations of $\mathrm{SO}(1,3)$ in which the fields transform are given by representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)$, i.e. half-integers $(s_1,s_2)$, we choose the representation $s_1+s_2$ of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to induce the full representation.</p>

<p>For the massless case, it becomes less natural - the little group is $\mathrm{ISO}(2) = \mathrm{SO}(2)\ltimes\mathbb{R}^2$, which has one-dimensional representation (labeled by the value of ""helicity"") as well as infinite-dimensional irreducible representations. The latter, I believe, are the ""continuous spin representations"" usually not occuring in physics. But what determines which one-dimensional representation to choose? The photon usually gets the <em>reducible</em> representation that is a sum of the representations of helicity +1 and -1, since parity interchanges them - can this be seen simply from the finite-dimensional representation of the field and knowing it's massless?</p>

<p>For the tachyonic case, I'm completely at a loss. The little group is $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)\cong\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, which has a plethora of rather complicated unitary irreducible representations given by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_SL2(R)#Unitary_representations"">Bargmann's classification</a>. I see no way to connect the representation of the field with any of these representations.</p>

<p>I travel by subway trains, and I noticed an odd phenomenon. The thing about such trains (might be irrelevant) is that, being light-weight, their motion somewhat mimics that of cars, and the effects of motion are more apparent as one usually stands in such trains. The thing I noticed was that I could feel a  force pulling me in the initial direction of motion, as the train slowed down. That obviously is the inertia. But as soon as the train halted, I noticed a secondary jerk...this time in the opposite direction, and it was kind of short lasting. </p>

<p>I'm curious to know, what causes this secondary jerk backwards as soon as a vehicle comes to rest. I'm guessing it has something  to do with the reaction force by the brakes which overcome the forward motion and provide an impulse backwards. But then it has to have a proper force 'mirror' as per the third law of motion. Also, there never is any intentional backwards motion here (the drivers are precise, I guess). </p>

<p>So what could it really be?  </p>

"270473","Integer number of wavelengths after the wavefunction is normalized in a cubic box","<p>One of the steps when learning quantum mechanics in three dimensions is to normalize $\psi$ in a cubic box of side $a$.

This means only an integer number of wavelengths fit in a length $a$, right?</p>

"270486","The Feynman propagator and the $i\epsilon$ prescription","<p>The Feynman propagator is usually represented in the i-epsilon form and texts solve the integral in this form (as opposed to doing the Feynman (time-ordered) contour on the real axis). Restricting ourselves to the integration over the $k_0$ component of the integral:
$$
\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } \frac{i e^{-i t k_0}}{(2 \pi )
   \left(\left(\text{i$\epsilon $}+k_0-\omega _k\right)
   \left(-\text{i$\epsilon $}+k_0-\omega _k\right)\right)} \, dk_0
$$</p>

<p>In doing the integral using the contour instead of using the i-epsilon displacement of the poles, I arrive at a slightly different answer. In trying to find my error, I resorted to a simpler integral, the Dirichlet integral</p>

<p>$$
\int_0^{\infty }
   \frac{\sin(a x)}{x}
   \, dx=\frac{\pi }{2}
$$
This is easily solved using a contour over or under the pole at the origin (depending on the sign of $a$).  But in solving the integral using the i-epsilon prescription (for example if the pole is displaced upward/downward on the imaginary axis to $\pm i\epsilon$):
$$
\int_0^{\infty }
   \frac{\sin(a x)}{x \mp i\epsilon} \, dx
$$</p>

<p>I don't get $\frac{\pi }{2}$ as the answer (the pole is inside or outside the contour depending on whether the contour closes in the upper half plane or lower half plane). For one choice of displacement I arrive at $\pi$ and for the other I arive at $0$ (they average to the correct answer!?) Where is my error? </p>

<p>In response to the replies (so far):
The pole is a simple removable pole and the integral is undefined at the origin since the integrand is 0/0. One way to evaluate this integral, is to first convert to exponential form</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{2} \text{Im} \int_{-\infty }^{\infty }
   \frac{e^{\text{iax}}}{x\pm \text{i$\epsilon
   $}} \, dx$$</p>

<p>if ""a"" is positive for example, you need to close the contour in the upper half plane.  But you get different results if the pole is displaced downward (integral=0) or upward (integral=$\pi$).</p>

  <p><strong>Source:-</strong> Mechanincs for JEE (Main &amp; Advanced) (Vol.-1) <strong>- Er. Anurag Mishra</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>My solution:-</strong></p>

<p>As we know the equation of trajectory of a projectile projected at an angle $\theta$ under the influence of gravitational force is given by </p>

<p>$$y=x\tan{\theta}-\dfrac{gx^2}{2u^2}(1+\tan^{2}{\theta}) \tag{1} $$</p>

<p>where $x$ and $y$ represent the cartesian coordinates.</p>

<p>Now, consider $t=0\text{ sec}$ as the point in time when the anti-aircraft gun fires a bullet to hit the the jet plane. So, to hit the aircraft the bullet must have the same coordinates as that of the jet plane at the time when the bullet reaches an altitude same as that of the jet plane, i.e. $250\text{ m}$. So, lets assume after $t$ seconds the bullet reaches a height of $250\text{ m}$. At that time the coordinates of the jet plane would be $(500t,250)$, so the $x-$coordinate of the bullet will be $x=500t$.</p>

<p>So, on substituting $u=100\text{ m/s}; g=10\text{ m/$s^2$}; y=250\text{ m}; x=500t$ in equation $(1)$, we get</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;250=(500t)\tan{\theta}-\dfrac{g(500t)^2}{2\times{100}^2}(1+\tan^{2}{\theta}) \\
\implies &amp;\dfrac{g(500t)^2}{2u^2}\tan^{2}{\theta}-(500t)\tan{\theta}+\left(250+\dfrac{g{(500t)}^{2}}{2{u}^{2}}\right)=0
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>Now, for the such a trajectory to exist $D\ge0$</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore  \qquad(500t)^2-4\dfrac{g(500t)^2}{2u^2}\left(250+\dfrac{g(500t)^2}{2u^2}\right)\ge0\\
\implies t^2(2-t^2)\ge0
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>The interval for $t$ is $t \in \left[-\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}\right]$ ,but as $t\gt 0$, so $t\in (0,\sqrt{2}]$. </p>

<p>So, the jet plane is in danger of being hit by the anti-aircraft gun for an interval of $\sqrt{2}$ seconds</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Solution of book:-</strong></p>

<p>The equation of trajectory of bullets is
$$y=x\tan{\theta}-\dfrac{gx^2}{2u^2}(1+\tan^{2}{\theta}) \tag{1}$$</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2PoXO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2PoXO.jpg"" alt=""danger zone according to book""></a>
For a given value of $x$, maximum $y$ can be determined from </p>

<p>$$\dfrac{dy}{d(\tan{\theta})}=x-\dfrac{gx^2}{u^2}(\tan{\theta})=0 \\ 
\implies \tan{\theta}=\dfrac{u^2}{gx}$$</p>

<p>On substituting the expression for $\tan{\theta}$ in equation $(1)$, we get </p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;y_{max}=\dfrac{u^2}{g}-\dfrac{gx^2}{2u^2}\left[1+\dfrac{u^4}{g^2x^2}\right] \\ 
\implies &amp; y_{max}= \dfrac{u^2}{2g}-\dfrac{gx^2}{2u^2}
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>The shell can hit an area defined by</p>

<p>$$y\le \dfrac{u^2}{2g}-\dfrac{gx^2}{2u^2}$$</p>

<p>On substituting numerical values, $y=250 m; u=100 m/s; g=10 m/s^2$, we get</p>

<p>$$\dfrac{x^2}{2000}\le 250 \implies -500\sqrt{2}\le x \le 500\sqrt{2}$$</p>

<p>The fighter jet, can travel $1000\sqrt{2}$ m while it can be hit. So, the plane is in danger for a period of $$\dfrac{1000\sqrt{2}}{500}=2\sqrt{2}\text{sec}$$</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My deal with the question:-</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Why does my answer and the books answer differ, what am I missing.</li>
<li>Why does the book's solution find out the maximum $y$ for a particular $x$(which I think is the position of the jet at some time as explained in my solution, correct me if I am wrong).</li>
<li>Why is it that the projectile can hit only the area defined in the solution, did it mean to say that only in that area the shell can hit the jet plane, if that is so then still I have the doubt why only that region.</li>
<li>Lastly, what could have been the inspiration of the author to come up with this solution</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>More elegant solution are always welcome.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 1:-</strong> I know this question has been asked <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/270437/"">here</a>, but as the OP did not provide any work so it has been put on hold, hence I provided my work and also, this is not a homework, I am solving it on my own.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 2:-</strong></p>

<p>As pointed out by all of the solvers, I had done a mistake in determining the reference time for the jet, so to correct that I tried the following. </p>

<p>Let the position of the jet in the cartesian plane be $(x+500t,250)$, where $-\infty\le x \le\infty$ and $\Delta t$ represents the time elapsed after firing the bullet from the gun and the bullet hitting the jet(as I could not think of anything good which could also tell that $t$ can be negative if we take $t=0$ as the reference time, so instead I defined $\Delta t$). On substituting these values into the equation of trajectory of the projectile we get,</p>

<p>Equation of trajectory of a projectile projected at an angle $\theta$ under the influence of gravitational force is given by</p>

<p>$$y=x\tan{\theta}-\dfrac{gx^2}{2u^2}(1+\tan^{2}{\theta}) \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>On substituting $(x+500t,250)$, in equation $(1)$, we get</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
&amp; 250=(x+500t)\tan{\theta}-\dfrac{g(x+500t)^2}{2u^2}(1+\tan^{2}{\theta}) \\
\implies &amp; \dfrac{(500t+x)^2g}{2u^2}\tan^2{\theta}-(500t+x)\tan{\theta}+\left(250+\dfrac{(500t+x)^2g}{2u^2}\right)=0 \\
\implies &amp; \dfrac{(500t+x)^2}{2000}\tan^2{\theta}-(500t+x)\tan{\theta}+\left(\dfrac{5\times10^5+(500t+x)^2}{2000}\right)=0 
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>Now, for such a trajectory to exist $\tan{\theta}\in \mathbb{R}$, so $D\ge0$</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \qquad &amp;(x+500t)^2-4\left(\dfrac{(500t+x)^2}{2000}\right)\left(\dfrac{5\times10^5+(500t+x)^2}{2000}\right) \ge 0 \\
\implies &amp; (500t+x)^2(5\times10^5-(500t+x)^2)\ge 0
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>Now , let $(500t+x)=p$, then the above inequality becomes</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;p^2(5\times10^5-p^2)\ge0 \\
\implies &amp;-500\sqrt{2}\le p\le 500\sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>As we can see that $p=(500t+x)$ represents the $x$-coordinate of the jet, so we get that the jet is in danger as represented in the above inequality for $\boxed{2\sqrt2}$ seconds.</p>

<p>Please do tell me if I had done any mistakes, and seems like the solution of the book is way more intuitive and short.</p>

"270535","How to explain implicit time dependence to someone?","<p>I am trying to explain what <em>implicit</em> time dependence is and how it differs from <em>explicit</em> time dependence, but I'm unsure how ""sound"" my explanation is. Here is what I said:</p>

<p>Suppose I have a function $T(x,y,z,t)$ which is a temperature field of a room. If $T$ has <em>explicit</em> time-dependence, then even though I may stay at a fixed point, $(x,y,z)$, in the room, the value of $T$ at that point can change over time, the temperature may increase or decrease over time. Now, suppose for simplicity that the temperature at each point in the room doesn't change in time, i.e. $T$ has <em>no explicit</em> time dependence such that $T=T(x,y,z)$. </p>

<p>Then, suppose that I start walking around the room, now the temperature at each point remains <em>fixed</em>, but now my position $(x(t),y(t),z(t))$ is time dependent, i.e. it changes in time due to me walking around the room. As such, the temperature function $T$, that I use to measure the temperature at each point, is said to have <em>implicit</em> time dependence since its value changes over time, not due to the value at each given point changing over time, but because the position, $(x(t),y(t),z(t))$, at which it is evaluated, is changing over time.</p>

<p>Hence, for explicit time dependence, we have that $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\neq 0$, since even if my position remains fixed, the temperature at that point is changing over time. For implicit time dependence (and no explicit time dependence), we have that $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}= 0$, since the value of the temperature at each point is fixed in time, however, $\frac{dT}{dt}\neq 0$, since my position is changing over time and so the temperature will implicitly change over time due to my movement around the room.</p>

<p>Would this be a correct explanation at all, or would something else be better?</p>

  <p>Can I derive the point charge Lagrangian 
  $$ L = -\frac{mc^2}{\gamma} - \frac{1}{c} J_{\mu} A'^{\mu}\tag{1} $$
  from the Abelian Yang-Mills Lagrangian 
  $$L = \int d^3x [ - \frac{1}{16 \pi} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{c} J'_{\mu} A^{\mu}] ~~? \tag{2} $$ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recognized that one is the Lagrangian for a point charge and the other is the Lagrangian for the EM fields, and I know that each is derived independently using Lorentz invariance, unit analysis and static limits (see Jackson sections 12.1A-B, 12.7) but surely there must be a relationship between the two?</p>

<p>The Lagrangian for a point electric charge located at $\vec{r}$ is, according to Jackson's ""Classical Electrodynamics"" equation 12.12, $L = -m c^2 \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} +  \frac{e}{c} \vec{v} \cdot \vec{A}' - e A'_0 = -\frac{mc^2}{\gamma} - \frac{1}{c} J_{\mu} A'^{\mu}$, where $J_{\mu} = e \delta(\vec{r}) \cdot u_{\mu}$ and $u_{\mu} = \gamma(c,\vec{v})$. In other words, this is the Lagrangian for an electron of mass $m$ and four-current $J_{\mu}$ interacting with external electromagnetic fields $A'_{\mu}$. The associated action is $S = \int L dt = \int \gamma L d \tau$.</p>

<p>The Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field $A_{\mu}$, according to Jackson equation 12.85 is $\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{16 \pi} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{c} J'_{\mu} A_{\nu}$, where $J'_{\mu}$ is the current density associated with external field sources/charges. In other words, this is the Lagrangian describing the dynamics of the electromagnetic field $A_{\mu}$ interacting with external field sources described by $J'_{\mu}$. The associated action is $S = \int \mathcal{L} d^4 x = \int L dt = \int \gamma L d\tau$.</p>

<p><strong>My attempt:</strong></p>

<p>I need to convert Lagrangian (2) from describing the dynamical fields $A_{\mu}$ interacting with external charge distributions $J'_{\nu}$ to something which describes the dynamics of a charge distribution $J_{\mu}$ (which generates field $A_{\mu}$) interacting with external field $A'_{\nu}$ (which is generated by $J'_{\nu}$).</p>

<p>I integrate by parts the $-F_{\mu \nu}^2$ term in equation (2) to obtain $A_{\mu} (\partial_{\nu} F^{\nu \mu}) + \partial_{\mu}(A_{\nu} F^{\nu \mu})$. According to the Euler-Lagrange equation $\frac{c}{4\pi} \partial_{\nu} F^{\nu \mu}=J'^{\mu}$, i.e. the change in the curvature $\partial_{\nu} F^{\nu \mu}$ results from the presence of the external current-density $J'^{\mu}$, analogous to how an acceleration results from an external force. </p>

<p>I believe the $\partial_{\mu}(A_{\nu} F^{\nu \mu})$ term should yield something like the electric flux through the boundary of the space for field $A_{\mu}$, which is just the charge, allowing me to derive a $J_{\mu}$ term (not a $J'_{\nu}$ term). But expanding this term gives $\partial_{\mu}(A_{\nu} F^{\nu \mu}) = \partial_0(-A_i E^i) - \partial_j(-A_0 E^j) + \varepsilon^{kij} \partial_j (A_i B_k)$.</p>

<p>But I get stuck here, and cannot seem to derive either a $J_{\mu}$ term or a mass term like $-m c^2 / \gamma$. Does anyone have any pointers for me? I'd be much obliged. </p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>I have read the following and my question is not a duplicate of either, as I know the two Lagrangians above are derived independently using Lorentz invariance, unit analysis, and known static limits:

  <p>A metal sphere of radius $R$ carries a total charge $Q$. What is the force of repulsion between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this problem you consider the force per unit area on the surface of the northern hemisphere and then add it up basically: You get the average electric field as $\frac{1}{2}(E_{\text{outside}} + E_{\text{inside}}) = {E_{ave}} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{R^2}\hat{r}$ Because of the symmetry the horizontal components cancel for the force per unit area you get $f_{z} = \sigma (E_{ave})_{z}$ where $\sigma = \frac{Q}{4 \pi R^2}$. Then the total force on the northern hemisphere is $$F_{z} = \int f_{z} da = \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (\frac{Q}{4 \pi R^2})\frac{1}{2}(\frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^2}) \cos \theta R^2 \sin \theta d \theta d \phi = \frac{Q^2}{32 \pi R^2 \epsilon_0}.$$</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> Are the forces of repulsion on the northern hemisphere a result of only the charges from the southern hemisphere while there is symmetric cancellation from charges in the northern hemisphere or is the force on each unit area in the northern hemisphere due to the whole sphere?

"270568","Providing an intuitive description of scalar and vector quantities in physics","<p>Often the standard introduction to the concept of scalars and vectors in physics is something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A scalar is a quantity that is completely described by a single number (it has no directional dependence). A vector is a quantity that requires both a magnitude (a number) and a direction to be specified  in order to completely describe it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is then followed up by examples of the two, such as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mass, charge and distance are all examples of scalar quantities, whereas, velocity, displacement and force are all examples of vectors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel what is often missed out is a physically intuitive explanation of why certain quantities are vector quantities whilst others are scalars. I have thought up of a few examples and I'm hoping that people can provide feedback, and/or suggest some intuitive examples/explanations.</p>

<p>An example of a <em>scalar</em> quantity is <em>temperature</em>. Indeed, the temperature at a point is completely specified by a single number. It is rotationally invariant, in the sense that facing northwards, or south-eastwards (or indeed any other direction) at the same point does not affect the temperature at that point. Therefore it has no directional dependence and is a scalar. Another example would be distance. A distance of $n$-meters measured from one point to another remains $n$-meters, regardless of which direction it is measured in and hence it is a scalar quantity.</p>

<p>An example of a <em>vector</em> quantity would be an objects <em>velocity</em>. In order to determine the motion of an object it is clearly not enough to simply provide the speed at which it is travelling. The object will travel in a particular direction, and so two objects travelling at the same speed, but in different directions will end up at completely different locations. Hence, in order to completely specify the motion of an object one must use a vector quantity - the objects velocity. </p>

<p>Finally, the <em>force</em> acting on a object is also a vector quantity, since it acts in a particular direction on the body. Whether the force acts from the top, bottom or sides of the body will have different effects on the body, hence its action is clearly directionally dependent and must be described by a vector (two forces with the same magnitude, but acting in different directions on the same object will have different effects on the object).</p>

<p>Hopefully what I've written is coherent. I'm hoping to convey this information to a person with a fairly minimal background knowledge in physics, so any feedback about it would be much appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>To clear up ambiguity. I am not asking whether I have understood the concept correctly or not. This is more a question about How one should give an elementary introduction to vectors and scalars? I am not currently in education and so don't have a lecturer or fellow students to ask about this. I have been asked by someone to explain it to their teenage son and I wanted to hear the thoughts of others (most likely more capable than I) on how to teach this concept.</p>

<p>They all move to the boundary, rows representing wavefronts. First man goes into the mud, slows down. The second one as well after a while. The others are still moving faster (creating the notable shear in the wavefront, the bending). But there is absolutely $0$ reason to change direction beyond the forced narrative by a <strong>bad analogy</strong>. </p>

<p>It's the usual use of an unstated &amp; unproven assumption that each person will change direction to maintain perpendicularity towards the wavefront. <strong>In other words, it is assuming the mechanism of refraction that is attempting to prove.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, every analogy related to this is terrible. </p>

<p>There is an underlying process and I wish to examine it in as much detail as the framework in which it was developed allow. <strong>I am particularly against teleological explanations</strong> that involve the notion that the particle/wave does a spatial analysis before it proceeds on its path, so called least time principle. And it seems  to have sneaked its way even into explanations of quantum electrodynamics.</p>

<p>Some explanations just leave out the explanation part. They state that light (wave) in the context of classical mechanics slows down, but the frequency stays the same. <strong>And this somehow hand waves that the direction of light changes because of it.</strong> No, it doesn't.</p>

<p>What it does show is that if frequency is to stay the same, wavelength has to shorten along with the decrease in velocity, bringing the wavefronts closer together. As the energy of a wave is expressed in terms of its frequency (or wavelength), therefore is conserved through that.</p>

<p>For now, the best explanation which rolls over the former seems to come from the Huygens-Fresnel principle, generating spherical waves at the boundary with the shorter wavelength and recombing them into a new front, which justifies the change in direction somewhat. Image below illustrates.</p>

"270599","Quantum states after real world measurements","<p>Regarding measurements of an observable in a quantum system. My understanding, from the postulates of quantum mechanics, is that when we measure an observable quantity, the state of the system collapses to an eigenfunction of the linear Hermitian operator which corresponds to the observable: $$\hat{A}|\psi \rangle = y|y \rangle$$ 
where $y$ is the eigenvalue and $|y \rangle$ is the eigenstate. Then if we project onto the basis of the observable we get the dirac delta function. Let's consider the position operator for example, then: </p>

So the rhs in the equation $\oint B\cdot dl = \mu_0 I$ becomes zero which effectively means the magnetic field is zero.

"270728","Can this friction be ignored?","<p>I ran across this problem along with an answer.  The answer says that a certain force due to friction can be ignored, but I question whether that is correct.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/05gWY.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/05gWY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The question is: find the acceleration of block 2.  There is friction between block 2 and the floor with coefficient of friction $\mu_{2f}$, and there is friction between block 1 and block 2 with coefficient $\mu_{12}$.</p>

<p>The given answer starts
$$ (m_1 + m_2)a = F_a - F_\mathrm{friction\; on\; 2\; due\; to\; floor} - F_\mathrm{friction\;on\; 1\; due\;to\; 2}$$
$$ (m_1+ m_2)a = F_a - \mu_{2f}(m_1 + m_2)g - \mu_{12}m_1g$$
along with an explanation ""There is also a friction force on 2 due to 1, but that can be ignored.""</p>

<p>I don't see how we can ignore the friction force on 2 due to 1.  In order to make things as clear as possible, I might treat each mass separately in order to clarify the forces on each mass.</p>

<p>$$ m_1a_1 = -T +\mu_{12}m_1g$$
$$ m_2 a_2 = F_a -T -\mu_{2f}(m_1+m_2) - \mu_{12}m_1g  $$
$$ a_2 = -a_1 = a$$  The last term in the second equation explicitly accounts for the force on 2 due to 1.  This is the force that the given answer says can be ignored.
I'm wondering if I'm double counting the friction.  I saw this problem and answer in print, so I'm inclined to doubt my analysis.  Is the friction force on 2 due to 1 ignorable?</p>

"270730","Connection between BQP and Feynman Path Integral","<p>In chapter 10 of Scott Aaronson's book <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, he claims that Feynman path integral formulation immediately implies that the complexity class BQP (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial Time) is contained in PP (Probabilistic Polynomial Time). However, I don't see how the argument works. </p>

<p>Here is my understanding of it: any problem that can be reduced to a decision problem of <strong>whether or not the sum of exponentially many terms (each computable in polynomial time) is above a certain threshold</strong> is in PP. So Aaronson shows that by the Path Integral approach, all BQP computations can be reduced to such a decision problem. Great, so BQP is in PP.</p>

<p>But what I don't understand is why the traditional approach described by Aaronson doesn't work (see below):</p>

<p>""The obvious way to do it is to multiply a bunch of $2^n$ by $2^n$ unitary matrices, then take the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the amplitudes corresponding to accepting basis states (that is, basis states for which the output qubit is |1⟩).""</p>

<p>Isn't this computation also ""a sum of exponentially many terms (all the squares of absolute values of the amplitudes)""? So why do we need Feynman Path Integral to show that BQP $\subseteq$ PP?</p>

Some say it is found by placing the compass around a current carrying wire. Some say magnets always exist as dipole so field lines emerge from from north pole and end in south pole and so it looks circular. And <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/65335/how-do-moving-charges-produce-magnetic-fields"">this guy</a>  from stack exchange says</p>

<p><a href=""http://%20http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/171479/why-is-the-magnetic-field-circular"" rel=""nofollow"">And another guy</a> ,</p>

<p>""This electric field in the moving frame clearly exerts a radial force on any test charge originally at rest with respect to the wire in the stationary frame. But, given that there is no radial force or acceleration in the stationary frame, there also cannot be a net radial force on the charge when it is in the moving frame either. The force that counteracts the radial electric field in the moving frame is the Lorentz force due to a mystery (B-)field. As the Lorentz force due to the mysterious (B-)field ....""</p>

<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QuAHv.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QuAHv.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>then from proton's frame of reference , the protons on the wire appear to be denser than the electrons in the wire, so it must experience an outward force. So its path should be like a parabola. Field lines are found by tracing the path followed by a test charge or test mass or whatever,placing them in a field. So in case of magnetic field lines it should be a weird field line, not circular.</p>

<p>so why the magnetic field lines are circular? or How magnetic field is used as mathematical device as mentioned ?</p>

"270758","Is the universe deterministic when looking backwards?","<p>Someone once told me that if, in theory, we could know the position and motion of all the particles in the universe, we could use that data to run time backwards, and work out everything that had come before.  That means the current state of the universe effectively encodes all of history.</p>

<p>Is this theory reasonable?</p>

<p>I have two main concerns, so it would be great if you could address these in your answer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Due to <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/145081/doesnt-entropy-increase-backwards-in-time-too"">entropy</a>, information is lost over time.  I believe that means the same state could be arrived at by two different histories.  (For example, once a glass of water is still or frozen, we don't know if it was poured 100 years ago or 10,000 years ago.)  If that is true, I don't see how we could determine history from state alone.</p></li>
<li><p>From <em>A Brief History of Time</em> (Stephen Hawking) I got the impression that time was symmetrical: it acted the same regardless of which way it was running.  So if the universe is <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/63811/is-the-universe-fundamentally-deterministic"">deterministic going forwards</a>, that would also mean it is deterministic going backwards.  Was Hawking correct about time symmetry, or did I just misunderstand him?</p></li>

"270774","How to find static friction coefficient and the applied force's angle of inclination with a horizontal plane?","<p>Okay so I have this weird problem in my statics book that wouldn't come to a solution no matter what I tried. It states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A body of weight $4$ kg.wt is placed on a horizontal rough plane. If a force of magnitude $2$ kg.wt acts on the body with an inclination of $θ$ with the horizontal, or if a force of magnitude $4$ kg.wt acts on the body in the opposite direction of the previous force, the body is about to move. Find $θ$ and the coefficient of static friction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have tried to resolve the resultant of the two forces after they partially-cancelled each other, and I've tried to work with the first case alone, since in both cases the body is about to move and $F=μR$. But I could never reach a solution since in all the methods I've tried I always needed the normal reaction ($R$) and I can't get it without the relation $μR$ which equals $2cosθ$, because after resolving the force, the one pointing upwards was ($R+2Sinθ$) and I still had to get $θ$ in order to get mu or anything else. So basically my problem is with getting the theta. All I have so far is that $R=4-2sinθ$.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that I'm doing something wrong. This is my first time studying this topic (friction) in statics, and the problem is a horizontal plane case, which is supposed to be too simple. However, for some reason I'm not finding it simple at all. Is there something wrong with the problem altogether? As in, should they have provided more or other givens?

<p>$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\nabla\times\nabla\times\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int\left(\frac{\mathbf{J(x')}}{\mathbf{|x-x'|}}\right)\,d^3x$$</p>

<p>and exploiting some identities (like the Laplacian/Dirac identity derived earlier) to simplify the problem.</p>

<p>However, as he is wont to do, he leaves out most of the steps in the computation, and there is an especially egregious omission from 5.20 to 5.21 that I am having trouble understanding.</p>

<p>He simplifies the first expression to something more tractable, namely:</p>

<p>$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=-\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\,\nabla\int\mathbf{J(x')}\cdot\nabla'\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}\right)\,d^3x'+\mu_0\mathbf{J(x)}$$</p>

<p>And then, in a rather cryptic statement, says ""integration by parts yields:""</p>

<p>$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=-\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\,\nabla\int\frac{\nabla'\cdot\mathbf{J(x')}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}\,d^3x'+\mu_0\mathbf{J(x)}$$</p>

<p>I've worked through most of the work, but there are still a few steps that escape me.</p>

<p>By integration by parts, he almost certainly means applying the identity $\mathbf{A}\cdot\nabla \psi = \nabla\cdot(\psi\mathbf{A})-\psi(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A})$, which reduces the problem to</p>

<p>$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\nabla\int\frac{\nabla'\cdot\mathbf{J(x')}}{|\mathbf{x-x'}|}\,d^3x'-\nabla\int\nabla'\cdot\left(\frac{\mathbf{J(x')}}{|\mathbf{x-x'}|}\right)\,d^3x'+\ ...$$</p>

<p>For steady state magnetic phenomena, the first integrand vanishes (since $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}=0$), but the second remains.</p>

<p>$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=-\nabla\int\nabla'\cdot\left(\frac{\mathbf{J(x')}}{|\mathbf{x-x'}|}\right)\,d^3x'+\ ...$$</p>

<p>I have no idea how to show that this term vanishes. I'd use the divergence theorem to transform the volume integral to a surface integral, but the integrand is not $C^1$ with the singularity at zero, so I'm not sure I can. Jackson does something clever with an $a$-potential </p>

"270802","Questions about T- and U- dualities and the non-compact U(1)","<p>I'm studying Witten's paper, ""<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124"" rel=""nofollow"">String Theory Dynamics in Various Dimensions</a>"" (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124"" rel=""nofollow"">arXiv:hep-th/9503124</a>), and have a few questions from this paper about T- and U- dualities.</p>

<p>On page 3, in the last paragraph, Witten says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...in $d &lt; 10$ dimensions, the Type II theory (Type IIA and Type IIB are equivalent below ten dimensions) is known to have a $T$-duality symmetry $SO(10-d, 10-d; \textbf{Z})$. This $T$-duality group does not commute with the $SL(2, \textbf{Z})$ that is already present in ten dimensions, and together they generate the discrete subgroup of the supergravity symmetry group that has been called $U$-duality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong> (just to make sure I get this right): From Vafa's lectures (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9702201"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9702201</a>), I understand that the T-duality group corresponding to compactification of a Type-II theory on a $d$-torus $T^d$ is $SO(d, d; \textbf{Z})$. So is Witten here referring to a compactification of a $10$-dimensional theory on $T^{10-d}$, i.e. a $(10-d)$-torus, so that there one gets a $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold times a $(10-d)$-dimensional torus?</p>

<hr>

<p>In the footnote on pages 3-4, Witten says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, in five dimensions, T-duality is $SO(5, 5)$ and U-duality is $E_6$. A proper subgroup of $E_6$ that contains $SO(5, 5)$ would have to be $SO(5, 5)$ itself or $SO(5,5) \times \textbf{R}^*$ ($\textbf{R}^*$ is the non-compact form of $U(1)$), so when one tries to adjoin to $SO(5,5)$ the $SL(2)$ that was already present in ten dimensions (and contains two generators that map NS-NS states to RR states and so are not in $SO(5,5)$) one automatically generates all of $E_6$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Is $\textbf{R}^\star$ the same as $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ described on Stackexchange <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/53012/what-is-meant-by-a-non-compact-u1-lie-group"">here</a>? Is the notation standard? Where else can I find it? (Some string theory text?)</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong>: How do I know whether the proper subgroup of $E_6$ that contains $SO(5,5)$ is $SO(5,5)$ itself or $SO(5,5) \times \textbf{R}^*$? What is the motivation for including $SO(5,5) \times \textbf{R}^*$ in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>Question 4</strong>: I understand that the $SL(2)$ being referred to is the S-duality group for Type-IIB in $D = 10$ dimensions (so it is $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ for Type-IIB SUGRA in $D = 10$ and it is $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ for Type-IIB string theory in $D = 10$). But I am confused by the phrase ""when one tries to adjoin to $SO(5,5)$ the $SL(2)$ that was already present in ten dimensions..."". My question is very silly: why are we trying to adjoin a T-duality group in 5 dimensions with an S-duality group in 10 dimensions in the first place? [Disclaimer: I am fairly certain I have misunderstood Witten's point (and the language) here, so I welcome a critical explanation!]</p>

"270817","How does relative velocity change when there is a translation of axes?","<p>I was going through a textbook (Hibbeler, <em>Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics</em> 14th ed.) and the following passage stumped me. The chapter was on the relative motion of two particles using a translation of axes. I don't understand how the direction of $r_{B/A}$ stays constant between two moving objects or if I'm mis-interpreting what the passage is saying.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An equation that relates the velocities of the particles is
  determined by taking the time derivative of the above equation, i.e.</p>
  
  <p>$v_B = v_A + v_{B/A}$ (12–34)</p>
  
  <p>Here $v_B = dr_B/dt$ and $v_A = dr_A/dt$ refer to absolute velocities, since
  they are observed from the fixed frame; whereas the relative velocity
  $v_{B/A} = dr_{B/A}/dt$ is observed from the translating frame. </p>
  
  <p><strong>It is important to note that since the x', y', z' axes translate, the components of $r_{B/A}$ will not change direction and therefore the time derivative of these components will only have to account for the change in their
  magnitudes.</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Equation 12–34 therefore states that the velocity of B is
  equal to the velocity of A plus (vectorially) the velocity of “B with
  respect to A,” as measured by the translating observer fixed in the
  x, y, z reference frame.</p>

"270858","Electrostatic potential within a conductor","<p>It states that electric field inside a hollow conductor is zero due to reasons of rearrangement of charges on the surface of a conductor whenever there is an excess charge placed on it and the hollow region (say air) encloses no charge.</p>

<p>How can the work done to move a test charge placed in the interior of the conductor be zero? This is what my textbook says.

<ol>
<li><p>There are some transmission peaks, if the optical path legth between two beams is a multiple integer of the wavelength, i.e.
$$2 l \cos(\theta) n= m \lambda\ ,$$</p>

<p>where $l$ is the length of the cavity, $\theta$ is the refraction angle, $n$ is the refractive index.</p>

<p>But this means, that actually the condition for a maximum in transmission does also depend on the angle of the incident waves. But if you look at  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabry%E2%80%93P%C3%A9rot_interferometer#/media/File:Fabry_Perot_Interferometer_-_diagram.png"" rel=""nofollow"">this picture</a>, </p>

<p>then the incident angles should cover a broad variety of angles. So for any cavity length, there should be some incident light rays that should hit the cavity with the corresponding angle for a maximum in transmission. </p></li>
<li><p>If you put a screen behind a Fabry-Pérot interferometer, then you can see an interference pattern. What is exactly the condition that you can see an interferene pattern? I do not mean the condition under which you can see a maximum of intensity on the screen, but I'm rather looking for a condition that connects the maximum in transmission and the interference pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>In a paper, it says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the cavity is not quite perfectly resonant, that is, the laseres frequency is not quite an integer multiple of the free spectral range but blose enough to build up a standing wave, then...</p>

<p>I have got two questions concerning this quote:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shouldn't there always be a standing wave? Doesn't the frequency of the incident light change? I mean, the reflecting planes kind of impose the condition a potential $V=\infty$, so that there should be nodes at the reflecting planes?</p></li>
<li><p>I don't really get why there should be a standing wave in the cavity anyway. In the picture above, you can clearly see that the light rays don't propagate in a direction that is orthogonal with respect to the reflecting planes. So can there really be a standing wave?</p></li>

"270882","Friction loss in a vertical pipe flow","<p>I made this problem for more understanding of pressure and pressure loss in vertical flow.</p>

<p>Consider the following steady system, where a fluid enters a tank and exits through a vertical pipe of length $L$ and diameter $D=2R$. Height of fluid in the tank is constant and equals to $H$. Density and viscosity of liquid are $\rho$ and $\mu$, respectively. If flow is laminar find $Q$.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zDKN8.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zDKN8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now if I write Bernoulli's equation for the free surface of tank and exiting point of pipe, then I get$$\frac{P_{atm}}{\gamma}+\frac{v_0^2}{2g}+z_0=\frac{P_{atm}}{\gamma}+\frac{v^2}{2g}+z+h_l,$$where $h_L$ is the friction loss head of exiting pipe and $v=Q/(\pi R^2)$ and $\gamma= \rho g$. We know that $v_0 \approx 0$, thus$$H+L=\frac{v^2}{2g}+h_L$$
Now we need to find another relation between $v$ and $h_L$. Can we use Darcy–Weisbach equation? I think we can not due to vertical flow! I'm interested in writing momentum balance and derive the relation between friction loss and velocity (like Hagen–Poiseuille equation), but I don't know how to treat pressure terms! Is there a pressure distribution along the exiting pipe?</p>

<p><strong>Edit1:</strong> Momentum balance for the laminar flow in the pipe gives the velocity as$$v_z(r)=\frac{R^2}{4 \mu}\left(-\frac{dp}{dz}+ \rho g \right) \left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2} \right) $$And integrating over cross section of pipe for the flow rate gives$$Q=\pi r^2 v=\int_{0}^{R} 2 \pi r v_z(r) \ dr=\frac{\pi R^4}{8 \mu} \left(-\frac{dp}{dz}+ \rho g \right)$$And finally$$-\frac{dp}{dz}+ \rho g=\frac{32 \mu v}{D^2}$$Now which one of the following is right and why?</p>

<p>1) $h_L=L(-dp/dz)/ \gamma=\frac{32 \mu v L}{\gamma D^2}-L$</p>

<p>2) $h_L=L(-dp/dz+ \rho g)/ \gamma=\frac{32 \mu v L}{\gamma D^2}$</p>

<p>I don't have a sense of $p$ here! Can you give a physical sense of pressure within the exiting pipe?</p>

<p><strong>MY ISSUE:</strong></p>

<p>In the above technique, we are using the same $x(t)$ function, which models upwards motion, to model the downwards motion too. </p>

<p>But I do not think this is valid because in the upwards motion, we have two forces working against us: weight force and resistive force. However, when we are moving downwards, the weight force is now assisting the particle's motion. In other words, the $x(t)$ function will no longer be valid if $t&gt;T_U$.</p>

<p>I cannot see any reason why this technique should work, yet I've found three sources all doing the same thing, so I am inclined to believe that I am missing something here, which is why I come to Physics SE. Could somebody shed some light on this scenario?</p>

<p><strong>SOURCE:</strong></p>

<p>I am very uncertain about the line </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For $t \geq t_m$, $v&lt;0$ and therefore $f(v)&lt;0$.</p>

"270908","Focussing laser at km range","<p>This has been stuck in my head and although I've found quite some info, I can't get to the final answer. I'm probably overthinking something, so I hope you can point it out or help me out otherwise.</p>

<p>I'm looking for the minimum spot size of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 1 µm laser of quality $M^2 = 1.5$</li>
<li>Leaving the system through a 40cm diameter lens</li>
<li>Being focused by that lens at a range of say, 5 km. (f=5000m)</li>
<li>EDIT: It concerns an in-atmosphere beam (say, at sea level) but turbulence, scintillation and similar effects can be ignored. For all intents &amp; purposes, it could be in vacuum.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's right in between the 'minimum spot size for microscopic applications' and 'spot size after thousands of km's of space travel' - resulting in me getting slightly confused on what is applicable and what is not.</p>

<p>Basically I've found a number of equations like  </p>

<p>$ D'=\frac{4\lambda f}{\pi D} $
and
$\omega_0= \frac{\lambda f}{\pi a}$ (with a= beam radius at 1/e^2 intensity)</p>

<p>Giving me a minimum diameter of 0.016m / radius of 0.008m at the provided range respectively, or  </p>

<p>$\omega(z) = \omega_0*\sqrt{1+(\frac{z}{z_r})^2}$
Coming up with a radius of 0.20016m. (This one assumes the beam waist is at the lens itself, which would be valid for much larger ranges but probably not so much for 5km)</p>

<p>While they all make sense, I ""feel"" they're not considering the general divergence of the beam.
The answers provided here (<a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/13648/physics-of-focusing-a-laser"">Physics of Focusing a Laser</a>) seem to be in the right direction. For example,
$\omega_0 = \frac{M^2 \lambda }{\pi \Theta }$
comes with the note<br>
<em>""Note that if you know the $M^2$ and measure the divergence of a beam, then you can calculate the waist radius.""</em></p>

<p>Now I can't measure the divergence of my laser (theoretical case :) ) but I don't think I can calculate it from that equation either, since although I know the radius at the lens, that is not the beam waist.</p>

<p>As you see, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I've just been looking at it for too long, garbling up my head. It'd be great if someone can clear this up for me!</p>

<p>What is the reason if this instability? In other words, why the larger domains tends to expand? I think that a strip uniformly magnetized has a lower energy. But, what is the energy term minimized by the one-domain configuration with respect to the two-domains configuration?</p>

<p>Now, I switch on an external magnetic field, directed along the easy axis of the strip. If its amplitude is ""small"" the larger domains expands as before. In this case reducing the smaller domain increase the Zeeman energy term of the strip. So, again, what is the energy therm minimized here?</p>

<p>(In all my reasonings I'm not considering the energy stored in the domain wall between the two domain: is it a big negligence?)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> after running some simulations the energy term that decreases in the one-domain configuration (without the external field applied) is the demagnetizing energy. But I can't figure out why.</p>

"270919","Noninertial frame of reference","<p>For a car that is accelerating linearly, the non-inertial frame of reference is the driver in the car where from his reference frame, the car is stationary. It is so called stationary because the non-inertial frame of reference has the same acceleration as the car. Is like the car's acceleration ""transform"" the driver frame of reference into a non-inertial. That's why in the non-inertial frame of reference, there is no force acting on the car.</p>

<p>But when the car is driving in circles at a constant speed, in the non-inertial frame of reference there is a force acting on the car, which is the centripetal force. Why isn't this frame of reference like the above, not having the acceleration found in their each respective inertial reference frame? Why can't we have a non-inertial reference frame(due to rotation) whereby there is no centripetal force, subsequently eradicating the need for a centrifugal force? Is it because the direction of motion is different from the direction of acceleration?</p>

"270922","Dispersion of Gaussian Beams","<p>I'm new to optics, especially Gaussian beam optics. I'm curious about things that I've been reading in Daniel Steck's textbook, and how they compare with my common sense intuition. Guassian beams are commonly used to model laser light, and typically are depicted according to this picture</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/GaussianBeamWaist.svg/2000px-GaussianBeamWaist.svg.png"" alt=""Gaussian Beam""></p>

<p>We can clearly see dispersion (or the spreading of the light) as we move along the z axis away from the waist (w0). But, as I think about the lasers I use for pointing at stars for instance, they seem intuitively to have some diameter which remains constant as the light shines away from the source. In other words, intuitively it seems that there is no dispersion or spread for a laser I use to point at stars.
     Or is it just that the dispersion is very small so that I can't notice it? 
      Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

By simple, and probably naive, logic, one could then conclude that wind, which is basically just moving air, would raise the temperature of the air.</p>

<p>However, this seems too simple to be true.  Does wind actually slightly raise air temperature?</p>

<p>I can see a couple potential arguments against this idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>It could be the case that the macroscopic wind and the microscopic kinetic energy of the air molecules don't really ""interact"", for lack of a better word.</li>
<li>It could be the case that the macroscopic and the microscopic motions do ""interact"", but since the macroscopic wind is on such a large scale compared to the average kinetic energy of individual molecules, any system in which we use the average kinetic energy of the molecules is so small that the wind is effectively constant, and so it could be ignored.</li>
<li>Regardless, I'm guessing that the temperature only depends on the relative motion of the air molecules, so the wind just isn't even relevant</li>

$$P=p_1+\cdots+p_n=(E,0,0,0),$$

<p>The set of all possible configurations $(p_1,...,p_n)$ satisfying these two constraints, i.e. $n$-tuples of vectors such that each is on mass shell and they sum up to our fixed vector is a compact subspace of $\mathbb R^{4n}$. If all masses are strictly greater than zero then the implicit function theorem implies that it is actually a smooth submanifold of dimension $3n-4$, but if some masses are nonzero I'm not sure if one can exclude existence of cusps. </p>

<p>For example for $n=2$ three spatial components of equation $P=p_1+p_2$ and mass-shell condition imply that they are of the form $p_1=(\sqrt{m_1^2+\vec p ^2}, \vec p)$, $p_2=(\sqrt{m_2^2+\vec p^2}, - \vec p)$. Energy equation $E=\sqrt{m_1^2+\vec p ^2} + \sqrt{m_2^2+\vec p ^2}$ fix length of $\vec p$ uniquely. However angles of $\vec p$ remain unspecified. Therefore set of all solutions is a sphere.</p>

What is the ratio $\dfrac{v_1}{v_2}$ of the velocities of the cars $?$ Assume the hailstorms fall vertically.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>My solution:-</strong></p>

<p>Let the initial velocity of hailstone w.r.t Earth be represented by $\vec{u}_{H/E}$, following the same analogy we define the following:-</p>

<ol>
<li>$\vec{v}_{H/E}$ - Final velocity of hailstone w.r.t Earth</li>
<li>$\vec{v}_{1/E}$ - Velocity of car $1$ w.r.t Earth</li>
<li>$\vec{v}_{2/E}$ - Velocity of car $2$ w.r.t Earth</li>
<li>$\vec{v}_{H/1}$ - Velocity of hailstone w.r.t car $1$</li>
<li>$\vec{v}_{H/2}$ - Velocity of hailstone w.r.t car $2$</li>
</ol>

<p>Now consider the following vector diagrams</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/e6rrC.png"" width=""550"" title=""Vector diagram of hailstone falling on 1st car"" ></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qff87.png"" width=""550""></p>

<p>From the above vector diagram ,we can conclude the following:-</p>

<p>$$|\vec{v}_{H/E}|\cos{\alpha}=|\vec{v}_{1/E}| \tag {1}$$
$$|\vec{v}_{H/E}|\cos{\beta}=|\vec{v}_{1/E}| \tag {2}$$</p>

<p>$\therefore$ The ratio $\dfrac{v_1}{v_2}$ can be obtained by $(1)/(2)$, so we get </p>

<p>$$\dfrac{|\vec{v_1}|}{|\vec{v_2}|}=\dfrac{\cos{\alpha}}{\cos{\beta}}=\dfrac{\cos\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-2\theta_1\right)}{\cos\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-2\theta_2\right)}=\dfrac{\sin{2\theta_1}}{\sin{2\theta_2}}=\dfrac{\sin{60^{\circ}}}{\sin{30^{\circ}}}=\sqrt3$$</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Book's Solution:-</strong></p>

<p>According to the observers in the cars, hailstones  bounce in the vertical direction which implies that the angle of reflection is $\theta_1$ as shown in figure below, which is same as angle of incidence in the cars' reference frame. Velocity of hailstones relative to the first car is $\vec{v}-\vec{v}_1$ as shown in the figure.
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rcXBx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rcXBx.jpg"" alt=""Book&#39;s vector diagram""></a></p>

<p>From figure, </p>

<p>$\alpha + 2\theta_1=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\tan{\alpha}-\dfrac{v}{v_1}$</p>

<p>Hence, $\tan{\alpha}=\tan{\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-2\theta_1\right)}-\cot{2\theta_1}$. So, $\dfrac{v}{v_1}=\cot(2\theta_1)$</p>

<p>Similarly, for second car, $\dfrac{v}{v_2}=\cot{2\theta_2}$</p>

<p>Thererfore ratio of velocities of the two cars, $\dfrac{v_1}{v_2}=\dfrac{\cot{2\theta_2}}{\cot{2\theta_1}}=3$</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My deal with the question:-</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>My main question:-</strong> Why isn't in the frame of reference of Earth is the reflection property applicable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what I thought regarding this is as follows:-</p>

<p>When the hailstone collides with the windscreen the impulsive force acting on the hailstone is only in the direction to their common normal. So, this only changes the component of the velocity of the stone perpendicular to the windscreen, but the velocity along the surface of the screen remains unchanged. Now, if this collision is drawn as a vector diagram(which I have shown) then we find that $\angle i=\angle r$($\angle i$-angle of incidence, $\angle r$-angle of reflection). Also the cars are not moving with an acceleration hence the hailstones do not experience any pseudo force(though pseudo force doesn't come into play here but still I just thought while trying to figure it out myself, that it could be a possibility so just mentioned it). </p>

<p>So, to conclude, my deal with the question is why is the reflection property only applicable in the frame of reference of car and not Earth.</p>

"271005","Maximum redshift of a ""bouncing"" universe","<p>Suppose a universe with only a cosmological constant and non-relativistic matter. Let $\varepsilon_c(t)$ be the critical density at time $t$, and let $\varepsilon_{c,0} = \varepsilon_c(t_0)$, where $t_0$ is the present day. The density parameter of the energy density of a given component of the universe is defined as $\Omega(t) = \frac{\varepsilon(t)}{\varepsilon_c(t)}$, and similarly define $\Omega_0 = \Omega(t_0)$. Hence the Friedmann equation of a universe with only cosmological constant and non-relativistic matter can be written as
$$
\frac{H^2(t)}{H_0^2} = \frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{a^3} + \frac{1-\Omega_{m,0} - \Omega_{\Lambda,0}}{a^2} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0}

$$

After that Ce$^{3+}$ ions become Ce$^{4+}$ ions, which possess absorption about 270 nm. And colleagues got used to say that under irradaition by photons with wavelength near 305 nm the process of photoionisation takes place. To me it sounds surprising because another rare earth ion Nd$^{3+}$ doesn't ionize under excitation, but only transfers to exited state.

"271042","Is it actually feasible to ""experience"" a 3rd dimension in a black hole","<p>Yet another thought experiment:</p>

<p>So consider an observer $O$ falling directly into a static spherical black hole. Now $O$ can be viewed as a physical system consisting of different parts exchanging information, however once $O$ enters the Event Horizon, any pieces of $O$ cannot send information in a direction that doesn't have positive directional component towards the center of the black hole. </p>

<p>Furthermore suppose we have two pieces of system $O$, $A$ and $B$ such that $B$ is closer to the center of the black hole than $A$, then if $A$ transmits any information to $B$ it can never receive anything from $B$, because such a transmission of information would mean that SOMETHING is moving away from the singularity, yet inside the Event Horizon.</p>

<p>So given that, it's not clear to me if the notion of ""3 dimensions"" makes sense for observers that have entered a black hole. Since as they are making their transit towards the singularity, any motion in the radial dimension, must necessarily be forward, and cannot be ""undone"", and so they don't appear to have any mechanism for measuring this 3rd dimension.</p>

<p>But that is just weird for me to consider, so I wanted to ask: if the idea I just considered makes sense, and if this would be a relatively accurate picture of what goes on once is sufficiently deep past the Event Horizon.</p>

where $V$ is the electric potential at distance $R$ from the charge $q$ and $d\bar{q}$ is a small part of $-q$ which I am bringing in and spreading around the shell. I took $d \bar{q} = \frac{q}{4 \pi R^2} R^2\sin \theta d\theta  d \phi$ and therefore $$W = \int dW = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{R} (\frac{q}{4 \pi}) \int^{2 \pi}_{0}\int^{\pi}_{0}\sin \theta d \theta d \phi = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q^2}{R}.$$ </p>

"271047","Use of tungsten as an insulator in an induction heater","<p>One problem in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_heating"" rel=""nofollow"">induction heating</a> is that energy is lost because the object being heated radiates energy, that energy then heats the coils (which are water cooled) and the coils suck away the energy.</p>

<p>One idea is to insulate the object being heated. For example, a thin-walled cylinder of polished tungsten could be placed between the object being heated and the coil. This will reflect some of the infrared energy being emitted from the object and reduce the heat loss. Another potential material is gold. So, for example, silica plated with the gold might be a possible. The issue with gold is that it is a good infrared reflector, but it melts at 1400C and the object can reach that temperature, so it would be at a borderline temperature for melting. Also, gold is not paramagnetic.</p>

<p>The problem with this idea is that tungsten is paramagnetic so it will absorb some of the energy from the coil.</p>

"271086","Lorentz Transformations in Index Notation","<p>So I was refreshing my special relativity knowledge for a review I need to write next year and was really confused by the following:</p>

<p>I was thinking about a frame $S$ with another frame $S'$ boosted along the $x$ direction of $S$. I know that a general Lorentz Transform can be written in index notation as:</p>

<p>$x'^\mu=L_{\nu}^{\mu}x^\nu$</p>

<p>Of course the interval between two events as observed from $S$ and $S'$ will be the same and this can be given by:</p>

<p>$\eta_{\alpha\beta}x^{\alpha}x^{\beta}=\eta_{\mu\nu}x'^{\mu}x'^{\nu}$</p>

<p>then using the first equation we can write:</p>

<p>$\eta_{\alpha\beta}x^{\alpha}x^{\beta}=\eta_{\mu\nu}(L^{\mu}_{\alpha}x^{\alpha})(L^{\nu}_{\beta}x^{\beta})=\eta_{\mu\nu}L^{\mu}_{\alpha}L^{\nu}_{\beta}x^{\alpha}x^{\beta}$</p>

<p>then we can simply rearrange this to write:</p>

<p>$(\eta_{\alpha\beta}-\eta_{\mu\nu}L^{\mu}_{\alpha}L^{\nu}_{\beta})x^{\alpha}x^{\beta}=0$</p>

<p>and so finally we can write</p>

<p>$K_{\alpha\beta}x^{\alpha}x^{\beta}=0$  where $K_{\alpha\beta}=\eta_{\alpha\beta}-\eta_{\mu\nu}L^{\mu}_{\alpha}L^{\nu}_{\beta}$</p>

<p>This is all basic. The book I was reading then went on to say that because this equation must hold for all coordinates then this implied that:</p>

<p>$K_{\alpha\beta}+K_{\beta\alpha}=0$</p>

"271089","How is it possible that pair production results in the decrease in a black holes energy?","<p>I learned that pair production near black holes can cause them to loose energy, and eventually stop. But this is because quantum fluctuations cause particle and anti-particle pairs and the anti-particle gets pulled into the black hole while the other particle goes off into space. The anti-particle causes the black hole's energy to decrease. My question is why the anti-particle goes in the black hole instead of the normal particle? I read it had something to do with a red-shift, but the response was quite vague. Also if nothing was to cause the anti-particle to go in the black holes, it would be a 50-50 chance that the normal particle or anti-particle enters the black hole.

<p><strong>My question</strong> is this:
When a force is applied on a object, does the entirety of the force act upon the object straight away or does the force gradually increase into becoming the said force?</p>

<p>Eg - If I exert a force of 5N, will it act on the object right away or will it gradually increase into being 5N? </p>

<p>It is a rather simple question really. I came to this question through my study of Newton's third law. When we apply a force of 50N on an object and the object can only withstand up to 30N of force, I am told that the force would only act up to 30 N, as that is the maximum reaction force that the object can provide. This brought me to the idea of a gradually growing force.( The force increases up to 30N and stops as it is the maximum force that the object can withstand) Am I wrong here? </p>

<p>If this is indeed correct, does the remaining 20N of force act as an unbalanced force on the parts of the object (now broken) and create an acceleration?</p>

  harmony with the given kinematic constraints. </p>
  
  <p>This postulate is not restricted to the realm of statics. It applies
  equally to dynamics, when the principle of virtual work is suitably
  generalized by means of d'Alembert's principle. Since all the
  fundamental variational principles of mechanics,  the principles of
  Euler, Lagrange, Jacobi, Hamilton, are but alternative formulations of
  d'Alembert's principle, Postulate A is actually the <em>only</em> postulate
  of analytical mechanics, and is thus of fundamental importance$^1$.</p>
  
  <p>$^1$Those scientists who claim that analytical mechanics is nothing
  but a mathematically different formulation of the laws of Newton must
  assume that Postulate A is deducible from the Newtonian laws of
  motion. The author is unable to see how this can be done. Certainly
  the third law of motion, ""action equals reaction"", is not wide enough
  to replace Postulate A.</p>

<p>By ""in harmony"" he means forces that keep rigid bodies rigid, that is, that don't break the stuff you're studying. In the next chapter he proceeds to prove all of mechanics is deducible from Newton's Second Law and d'Alembert's principle, which is philosophically elaborate, but mathematically resumes to transforming $F = ma$ into $F-ma=0$, which turns dynamics into statics.</p>

"
"271126","Understanding the effect of a quantum gate on an entangled system","<p>Recently I've been learning about quantum mechanics through studying quantum computers. I understand how a unitary transformation can be used to effect the amplitudes of a single qubit; for example, the Hadamard gate will do this:</p>

<p>$$
H(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) \rightarrow \frac{\alpha + \beta}{\sqrt 2}|0\rangle + \frac{\alpha - \beta}{\sqrt 2}|1\rangle
$$</p>

<p>So that, when the qubit is measured, we will see it is in state $|1\rangle$ with a probability of $\left|\frac{\alpha - \beta}{\sqrt 2}\right|^2$. However, this seems a lot more complicated to me when you take into account that qubits' states can be entangled with one another. My question is, what exactly happens when you apply a transformation to a single qubit in a many qubit system?</p>

<p>This is easy when the state is separable. For example, if the state of a 3-qubit quantum register is this:</p>

<p>$$
(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle)\otimes(\gamma|0\rangle + \delta|1\rangle)\otimes(\epsilon|0\rangle + \eta|1\rangle)
$$</p>

<p>then applying Hadamard to the second qubit will result in this:</p>

<p>$$
(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle)\otimes\left(\frac{\gamma + \delta}{\sqrt 2}|0\rangle + \frac{\gamma - \delta}{\sqrt 2}|1\rangle\right)\otimes(\epsilon|0\rangle + \eta|1\rangle)
$$</p>

<p>This calculation doesn't work in general though, because you can't necessarily write down the global state as a tensor product of separate qubits to begin with. In a quantum register, all you really know at any given time is that you have a vector of amplitudes:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_{000} &amp;
\alpha_{001} &amp;
\alpha_{010} &amp;
\alpha_{011} &amp;
\alpha_{100} &amp;
\alpha_{101} &amp;
\alpha_{110} &amp;
\alpha_{111}
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>

<p>such that $\sum |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$. Mathematically, what is the result of applying a transformation to a single qubit? How would I calculate the final state with a pen and paper?</p>

<p>I have an idea (which I'm not sure about), that passing a qubit to a quantum gate means <em>measuring</em> it first, which would implicitly mean measuring any other qubits it's entangled with. For example, if I measured the second qubit and saw it was $|0\rangle$, then every amplitude contradicting that measurement would collapse to zero, and the new (renormalized) vector would look like this:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha^\prime_{000} &amp;
\alpha^\prime_{001} &amp;
0 &amp;
0 &amp;
\alpha^\prime_{100} &amp;
\alpha^\prime_{101} &amp;
0 &amp;
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>

<p>I don't know if I'm thinking about this wrongly, but I'm at least still missing something. I still can't construct the new vector like so:</p>

<p>$$
(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle)\otimes H(|0\rangle)\otimes(\epsilon|0\rangle + \eta|1\rangle)
$$</p>

<p>because if the first and third qubits are entangled, then decomposing the state into a tensor product will still be impossible -- even after measuring the second qubit! So <em>how</em> does a quantum gate actually change the state of the system in a quantum circuit?</p>

"271127","What is the electric field outside a spherical capacitor?","<p>Two concentric spheres form a spherical capacitor with the same charges (but opposite signal). I know, by Gauss's law, that the electric field must be zero (actually, the flux must be zero, but I can't see how the flux can be zero and the electric field is not zero). But why there is no net field outside the spherical capacitor if the negative charges in the (for example) external sphere create a electric field in every direction - including de direction pointing to outside the sphere? (in this case, there is no other electric that could cancel it). So I think it's supposed to be like in this picture - and the external electric is falling off with the distance, as any electric field, and the electric field of the charge inside makes it fall off faster - though it is never zero. If it is so, why does Gauss's law says it is zero? If it's not, why? (in this latter case, how can we explain it NOT using Gauss's law, using only the charges and electric fields?) I suppose the same holds for cylindrical capacitors<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/h68Db.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/h68Db.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

"271134","What are the fields in a classical field theory?","<p>Consider scalar Yukawa theory. The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ contains an interaction term $$\mathcal{L}_I=g\psi^*\psi\phi$$ where $\psi$ and $\phi$ are complex and real scalars respectively. </p>

<p>I've never really thought about what this actually means. Now for scalars this isnt really a problem - I can just think of it as a product of numbers. But what about for more complicated representations of the Poincaré group? What about for interaction terms of various representations? </p>

<p>Suppose I have some term in the Lagrangian of the form $$W_A W_B W_C$$ where each $W_i$ is a field transforming in a different representation of the Poincare group. Something I read earlier gave me the impression that what's really written here is the <strong><em>tensor product</em></strong> of each field, since each field lives in a different representation, i.e. a different vector space.  </p>

<p>I've tried the case of a vector field and indeed everything works nicely. Let $A$ be a vector field, i.e. there exists a vector space $V$ with basis $\{e_\mu\}$ such that $$A=A^\mu e_\mu.$$ Now consider the following element $A^*$ in $V^*$ defined by $$A^*=A_\nu e^\nu$$ where $e^\nu$ are the basis vectors of $V^*$ satisfying $$e^\nu(e_\mu)=\delta^\nu_\mu$$ Now define a function $$f:V^*\otimes V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ by $$f(A^*\otimes A)=A^*(A)=A_\mu A^\mu$$ Hence I can put this term in my Lagrangian if I can show that it transforms as a Lorentz scalar. </p>

<p>The case I'm obviously interested in is when $V$ is $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ and my fields transform according to the vector representation of the Lorentz algebra, $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $\rho:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathfrak{gl}(V)$ be the vector representation, $x\in\mathfrak{g}$ and $\rho_x$ the corresponding element of $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$. Hence, under an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation we have $$A\rightarrow A+\delta A,$$ where $\delta A=\rho_x(A)$.</p>

<p>We also have a natural representation $(\rho^*,V^*)$ defined by $$(\rho^*_x(A^*))(A)=-A^*(\rho_x(A))$$</p>

<p>We also have a representation $(\bar{\rho},V^*\otimes V)$ defined by $$\bar{\rho}(A^*\otimes A)=\rho^*_x(A^*)\otimes A + A^*\otimes \rho_x(A)$$ It is then immediately clear that $f(A^*\otimes A)$ is invariant under an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation, as required. </p>

"271135","Why does induced current depend on the area of a loop of wire?","<p>My year 12 physics textbook teaches the concept of electromagnetic induction in a rather unintuitive way. Perhaps it is not being thorough. Perhaps I am not being thorough in reading it. Here is my problem:</p>

<p>The strength of a magnetic field has so far been described by the Magnetic Flux Density <code>B</code>: the force experienced by a length of current running perpendicular to the field lines. A few right hand rules make this concept grokable.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to teach induction, Magnetic Flux is defined as the Magnetic Flux Density multiplied by the <em>area</em> of effect: <code>(|) = B*A</code>. This is already muddying the water: We learn that, in fact, <code>B</code> is an odd kind of density, in that it is measured within an area, not a volume. The word 'Density' usually describes an amount per volume. Even so, the concept of Magnetic Flux is still not hugely difficult to understand.</p>

<p>The real problem arises when one starts to speak about induction of current in a loop of wire. ""The induced current in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of flux"". The difficulty is that the amount of flux affecting the wire loop depends on neither the thickness nor (directly) the length of the wire in question, but the <em>area enclosed by the wire</em>: The flux used to decide how much current is induced is that the wire wraps around, rather than some other quantity measured through the region of space that the wire also occupies.</p>

<p>It seems odd to me that the space that the wire does not pass through has anything to do with the current induced in the wire. I present a couple of thought experiments that cause me trouble:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The calculation of induced current apparently only works on closed loops: What of half loops? What of straight wires? They cannot be prescribed an ""area"" yet I am sure that they can induct.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine a bar magnet attached to a dart. The dart is thrown through loop of wire the size of a watch face, and the current in the loop is recorded. The experiment is repeated, but with a loop the size of a planet. It is not immediately obvious that a wire that is half a world away should induct more current than one in the same room. The magnet in question hardly produces a uniform magnetic field when stationary; is such a uniform field assumed?</p></li>
<li><p>Circular wires have greater loop-areas than equivalently long square wires, Yet the calculation is unaffected by the shape of the loop.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The textbook makes no argument as to why the loop's enclosed area is considered. I do not have access to the equipment necessary to test the claims. I am afraid I am missing some bigger picture. So, my question is, why <em>does</em> the area of a loop of wire have anything to do with the induced current (and voltage)? Is there no other, more general, or more intuitive calculation for induction? Perhaps the loop-of-wire calculation is just a special case of this.</p>

"271136","Can ultracentrifugation (very high gravity) influence time?

Then I saw on the web this question above coming up a couple years ago on this site but could not answer it anymore (discussion was closed with no clear answer).
I think that using the new ultracentrifuges (2 millions Gs), it can be done.  Putting a solution of Iodine 135 isotope in the centrifuge (half life 6,59 hours) and a reference Iodine 135 sample for the same origin outside the centrifuge and spinning it for one week, there should be a very significant difference. As you can see I am not a Physicist and not following all your discussions, I am a genome scientist working a lot in early years with ultracentrifugation for DNA isolation and now retired and interested in the relation between time and gravity.</p>

<p>The question here is a simple experiment where the decay of Iodine 135 that has been spun for one week at 2 millions Gs is compared to the decay of a reference sample that has been left on the table.  My intuition is that there will be a difference between the two samples.  It is a simple experiment (may not be at 2 millions Gs) with a simple measurement.  Any one interested in doing it?  </p>

<p>But the other day I was thinking if that definition agrees with the intuition behind constant speed (just in modulus). I mean, when somebody says ""X was moving with constant speed"" one automatically thinks that X is moving ""softly"", or, more precisely, it goes through a certain distance always in the same time(that's why speed is measured in lenght/time, I guess). That distance is not measured with the displacement vector, as far as I see. It is the length of the path that the particle has described. So, I believe that there should be a formal proof, that if $r(t)$ is function from $\mathbb{R
}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ (or to $\mathbb{R}^3$), and $r'(t)=v$, and $|v|$ is constant, then the function $r(t)$ describes a curve that has the same lenght in each interval of, say, lenght $[0,1]$ (1 second maybe). Does such proof exist? </p>

I have worked this out by equating the velocity given by kinetic energy multiplied by $q$ to the current and power as $IVt$. I think this makes sense since both the area and length of the wire do not affect how much resistance to motion electrons face.

"271191","Conservation of probablities with non-unitary matrices?","<p>In quantum mechanics, in the context of symmetry transformations, it is often said that for a transformation $T$ to conserve probabilities it must be unitary. </p>

<p>But by performing any (even non-unitary) transformation on the system we are just taking account for the fact we are looking at it in a different way (i.e. using different basis vectors).</p>

<p>By looking at the system in a different way I cannot see how we could change the probabilities of a measurement (as long as these probability where calculated correctly, which may need the introduction of a matrix into the scalar product). </p>

<p>My question is: where does this frame of reference end? </p>

<p>To the best of my limited understanding, gravity doesn't just stop at some point. Anything that has mass has gravity; gravitational waves (or whatever) extend from the mass spherically. They weaken as they get further away from the source, they get pushed around by other, more powerful, gravity waves, they become progressively weaker as the distance increases, but do they ever vanish completely, i.e. get reduced to absolute zero? Or do they become weaker and weaker forever, without zeroing out? And if so, where does a frame of reference end?</p>

"271199","Electromagnetic radiation flux through null infinity","<p>I encountered a problematic statement about electromagnetic radiation and I would be grateful if someone could shed some light on it.</p>

<p>The situation is the following:</p>

<p>Flat Minkowski space in 4D, with coordinates  $(u,r,z,\bar z)$, where $(z,\bar z)$ are (complex) angular coordinates (whose exact form is not of interest here), $r$ is the usual radial distance and $u=t-r$ is the retarded coordinate. Future null infinity $\mathscr{J}^+$ is the surface at $r=+\infty$ with coordinates $(u,z,\bar z).$ The gauge is $A_r=0$ everywhere, and $A_u=0$ (on $\mathscr{J}^+$).</p>

<p>The problematic statement is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>radiation flux through $\mathscr{J}^+$ is proportional to $\int_{\mathscr{J}^+} {F_u}^z{F_u}_z $,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>encountered in the article ""New symmetries in massless QED"" (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3789"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).</p>

<p>So my questions are:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>How is the integrand related to radiation? The closest thing I can imagine is the $T_{uu}$ component of the stress-energy tensor (without the term $g_{uu}(F)^2=g_{uu}(B^2-E^2)$ using the approximation $B^2\sim E^2$. But, again, I can't manage to link it to radiation.</p></li>
<li><p>It looks to me that we're missing the volume element of the surface, which turns out to be $r^2 \gamma_{z,\bar z}$ with $\gamma$ a function of $(z,\bar z)$. Since this integral is later asked to be nonzero and finite to impose some asymptotic behaviour on potentials $A$, the $r^2$ should be important here. Am I right on this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would be very grateful for any help on this. This is my first question so forgive me if I've missed something. Suggestions are also welcome.</p>

"271202","Interpretation of components of four-momentum in QFT","<p>In relativistic QFT one usually uses four-momentum vector $P^\mu$ which combines energy of a system with its momentum. I'm confused about the physical interpretation of the individual components of $P^\mu$. </p>

<p>Let's assume that the signature of the metric is $(1,-1,-1,-1)$. The zeroth component $P^0=P_0$ has, clearly, the interpretation of the energy of the system. But what is the spatial momentum of the system in the direction of $x$ axis? Is it $P^1$ or $P_1$? </p>

<p>I think that most people consider $P^1$ as the $x$ component of the spatial momentum. However, than it seems that the space-time translations are implemented differently in QM and QFT. In QM the state $\psi$ of the system shifted in time by $t$ and in space by $(x,y,z)$ is given by</p>

<p>$$ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}~ t\,P^0 -\frac{i}{\hbar} ~(x P_x+y P_y + z P_z)\right) \psi,$$</p>

<p>where $P^0\equiv H$ is the hamiltonian of the system and $P_x$, $P_y$, $P_z$ are the physical components of the spatial momentum. On the other hand in QFT the state $\psi$ of the system shifted in space-time by four-vector $x=(t,x,y,z)$ is given by</p>

<p>$$ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar} P\cdot x\right) \psi= \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}~ t\,P^0 +\frac{i}{\hbar} ~(x P^1+y P^2 + z P^3)\right) \psi,$$</p>

<p>which is equivalent to the previous formula if $P_1$ is the spatial momentum of the system in the direction of $x$ axis ($P_1 = P_x$ not $P^1=P_x$).</p>

"271203","Gravitational radiation from hydrogen atom","<p><strong>Background:</strong> It is known that orbital motion is accelerated motion under the influence of a central force; and that in a hydrogen atom the electron orbits the proton and is therefore accelerated; and that accelerated charges emit radiation; and that therefore the electron emits radiation, loses energy and falls into the proton; and that therefore hydrogen cannot exist. The paradox is resolved by saying that classical electrodynamics <em>alone</em> is not an adequate description of phenomena within the atom, so a quantum description is required. Or, to put it another way, hydrogen exists although it oughtn't, ""because quantum physics"". All this is uncontroversial.</p>

<p>But what about gravitational radiation?</p>

<p>The proton and electron form a mutually gravitating system, with the gravitational attraction between them being some $10^{-43}$ times the electrostatic attraction. Like any mutually orbiting masses, they must therefore emit gravitational radiation. Blindly following the formula in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave"">Wikipedia</a>, the power radiated appears to be $7.4\times{10^{-188}}$ watts, or $4.6\times{10^{-169}}$ eV per second.</p>

<p>I don't have time to wait several times $10^{169}$ seconds to see how hydrogen atoms age, so I thought it would be quicker to ask here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do we genuinely predict that hydrogen will emit gravitational radiation at approximately this rate, or does the ""because quantum physics"" override apply to gravitational radiation just as it applies to electromagnetic radiation?</p></li>
<li><p>What would it even mean, in the context of a hydrogen atom, where electrostatic forces predominate, for the atom to lose energy by gravitational radiation? How would an old atom look different from a young one? <em>(The absurdity of this question suggests that gravitational radiation may indeed be forbidden at the atomic level).</em></p></li>

"271213","Potential of conservative generalized forces","<p>In Gregory's <em>Classical Mechanics</em> there's a proof that when a standard system is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force"" rel=""nofollow"">conservative</a>, the generalized forces $Q_j$ can be written as a potential. But I can't seem to explain some steps in the proof. It goes like this:</p>

<p>Let $q^A$ and $q^B$ be two points of the configuration space that can be joined by a straight line parallel to the $q_j$-axis (why is this necessary?). Then</p>

<p>$\int_{q_A}^{q_B} Q_jdq_j = \int_{q_A}^{q_B} (\sum_i F^S_i \cdot \frac{\partial r_i}{\partial q_j})dq_j = \sum_i \int_{C_i} F^S_i \cdot dr = V(q^A) - V(q^B) = - \int_{q_A}^{q_B} \frac{\partial V}{\partial q_j}dq_j $ and since these hold for any two points in configuration space thus described, the integrands are equal.</p>

<p>Some words on notation:</p>

<p>$F^S_i$ are the specified forces acting on the particle $P_i$.</p>

<p>$\int_{C_i} F^S_i \cdot dr$ means the work done by $F_i$ on a particle moving along any path connecting $q^A$ and $q^B.$</p>

<p>The first equality is just using the defintion, as is the last one. So I'm mainly wondering about the justification for the second and third equalities.</p>

"271219","ISS and possible ways to generate artificial gravity for small spacecrafts","<p>This is just a break question, something to think about in breaks ... The ISS orbits let's say in a circle with the radius $R = 410 000$ m, has the mass $ M = 419 455$ kg, and it's orbital period is $T = 5400 $ s (90 min). Isn't it experiencing an centrifugal force $F = M\cdot R\cdot \omega^2$ with $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{5400} $ [rad/s] $F \approx M \cdot 0.55$.  So isn't everybody inside feeling that $0.55 $ m/$s^2$ acceleration? Some said that this is a duplicate of ""Gravity on the International Space Station"". But isn't that question about the gravity given by the force of gravity, whereas this question considers only the centrifugal force. As I stated in the comments below I am just curious to see if is possible to create some artificial gravity in outer space based on the movement of the craft. Why? The rotating cylinder or torus and similar ideas exist indeed, but they require enormous space objects out there spinning about their own axis. I thought that the ISS is already spinning around some axis therefore I was curious to see what centrifugal force is generated. Yes, because everything moves under the action of gravity while orbiting, including astronauts, there is no different force so everybody is ""falling alike"". But ... if a certain orbit would be controlled, say an artificial orbit not completely determined by gravity, which acts on astronauts too, using motors acting on the walls of the space station. 
     Another way for a small spacecraft to have artificial gravity, I think, would be to rotate around it's orbit like in the picture. That is the spacecraft is rotating in a circle in a plane orthogonal on orbit. I am just curious.

"271220","Gyroscopic Force/Torque of a Constrained Wheel","<h2>Description</h2>

<p>I have a wheel spinning away from me in the vertical plane. The angular momentum is pointing to the left. The axis of rotation is horizontal, and it is supported on either side by a bearing. Think of a free spinning bike wheel. If I then rotate the whole assembly, bearings and wheel, about the vertical axis, i.e. perpendicular to the axis of rotation, it will induce a torque in the vertical direction. Given what I understand about angular momentum and gyroscopes the wheel would want to resist this and instead rotate in the direction that would align it's horizontal angular momentum vector with the new vertical torque vector. Below is an image of what I am talking about.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3AAIF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3AAIF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The dotted arc shows the direction that the wheel would attempt to go. The Gyro Force exerted on the two bearings is what I am looking for. Also the arrows are not to scale and are unrelated to magnitude, they are only there to show direction. If anything is unclear please let me know and I will gladly attempt to clarify.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How do I calculate the force that would be applied to both bearings by the wheel wanting to turn in the vertical plan perpendicular to it's spinning plane?</p>

<p>If it makes the problem easier we can also assume that I know omega_p which is the pivot speed of the whole setup.</p>

<p>I've searched all over the web for the answer to this question and can't seem to find the answer. I keep coming up with the speed that it would precess or direction of precession. I'm looking for the magnitude of the torque/force that the wheel applies to the bearings.</p>

"271274","Noether's theorem and Invariance of Lagrangian under translation","<p>Consider a coordinate system in which the point A has coordinate $z_0$ and point B has ccordinate $z$ where there is a particle of mass $m$. Let there be a constant gravitational field of Earth. The Lagrangian of a particle in this system is given by $$L=\frac{1}{2}m(\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2)-mg(z-z_0)$$ where the potential energy of point B is measured w.r.t point A. Now consider different coordinate system where the origin is shifted from $x=y=z=0$ to $x=y=0,z=\alpha$. In this coordinate, A has coordinate $z_0+\alpha$ and B has coordinate $z+\alpha$. Therefore, <em>although the coordinate $z$ is not cyclic</em>, the Lagrangian remains invariant under translation in the $z$ direction. Therefore, by Noether's theorem, the momentum $p_z$ should be conserved. But as we know this is not the case due to constant gravitational field along $z$-direction. Is this not a contradiction?</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Work</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Construction of null operator and identity operator from eigenbasis of Hermitian operator:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) To show that it's a null operator it's sufficient to take some arbitrary $\mid \gamma \rangle$ belonging to the linear span of the eigenbasis $\{ \mid a' \rangle\}$, and show that </p>

<p>$$\left(\prod\limits_{a'}(A - a')\right) \mid \gamma \rangle = \left| 0 \right\rangle$$ (equation 1)</p>

<p>So, we have </p>

<p>$$A \mid a' \rangle = a' \mid a' \rangle$$ (equation 2)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$\mid \gamma \rangle = \sum_{a'} \langle a'\mid \gamma \rangle \mid a'\rangle$$ (equation 3)</p>

<p>Using (3) in the LHS of (1), therefore, yields,</p>

<p>$$\sum_a' \langle a' \mid \gamma \rangle \prod\limits_{a''}(A-a'') \mid a' \rangle  = \sum_{a'} \langle a' \mid \gamma \rangle \prod\limits_{a''}(a' - a'') \mid a' \rangle = \left| 0 \right\rangle $$ (equation 4)</p>

<p>as when $a'' = a'$ inside the continued product, we get a $0$. </p>

<p>(b) From the previous calculation it's clear that:</p>

<p>$$\prod\limits_{a'' \neq a'} \frac {A - a''}{a' - a''} \mid \gamma \rangle = \sum_{a'} \langle a' \mid \gamma \rangle \cdot 1 \cdot\mid a' \rangle = \mathbb{I} \mid \gamma \rangle$$</p>

<p>$$\Longrightarrow \prod\limits_{a'' \neq a'} \frac {A - a''}{a' -a''} = \mathbb{I}$$ (equation 5)</p>

<p>(c) Illustration for $A = S_z$ of a spin $\frac {1}{2}$ system:</p>

<p>Let $\mid + \frac {1}{2} \rangle$, $\mid - \frac {1}{2} \rangle$ be the eigenvectors of $S_z$ operator. The $S_z$ operator can be decomposed as:</p>

<p>$$S_z = \mathbb{I}\cdot S_z\cdot \mathbb{I} = \left(\mid + \frac {1}{2} \rangle \langle + \frac {1}{2} \mid + \mid - \frac {1}{2} \rangle \langle - \frac {1}{2} \mid \right) S_z \left( \mid + \frac {1}{2} \rangle \langle + \frac {1}{2} \mid + \mid - \frac {1}{2}\rangle \langle - \frac {1}{2} \mid \right)$$
$$= \langle + \frac {1}{2} \mid S_z \mid + \frac {1}{2} \rangle \cdot\mid + \frac {1}{2}\rangle \langle + \frac {1}{2} \mid + \langle - \frac {1}{2} \mid S_z \mid  -\frac {1}{2} \rangle \cdot\mid  -\frac {1}{2} \rangle \langle - \frac {1}{2} \mid$$
$$= \frac {\hbar}{2} \left( \mid + \frac {1}{2} \rangle \langle + \frac {1}{2} \mid - \mid - \frac {1}{2} \rangle \langle - \frac {1}{2} \mid \right)$$ (equation 6)</p>

<p>The null operator $\hat{O}= (S_z - \frac {\hbar}{2}).(S_z + \frac {\hbar}{2}) = S_z^2 - \frac {\hbar ^2}{4} \mathbb{I}$ and the identity operators are $\mathbb{I} = \frac {S_z}{\hbar} + \frac {\mathbb{I}}{2}$, $- \frac {S_z}{\hbar} + \frac {\mathbb{I}}{2}$ </p>

<p><strong>Where I'm having trouble</strong></p>

<p>The problem is with the very last result, on the last line of the page. I am getting</p>

<p>$$S_z=\frac{\hbar}{2}\mathbb{I}$$ and also $$S_z=-\frac{\hbar}{2}\mathbb{I}$$</p>

<p>which is clearly not correct. My guiding equation has been equation 5 (which seems to be correct). I have put $A=S_z$ of a spin 1/2 system in equation 5. I cannot locate the flaw in the steps.</p>

"
"271290","Action of the Schrödinger Equation and possible misconceptions regarding Variational Calculus","<p>I'll start by claiming that the action of the Schrödinger equation is the following:</p>

<p>$$\int \frac {h^2} {2m}\psi^{*'} \psi^{'} + \psi^* (V-E) \psi dx$$</p>

<p>To verify this, let's take the variation of it with respect to a small variation in $\psi^*$ and equate that to zero (note that $\psi^*$ and $\psi$ are considered independent):</p>

<p>$$\delta \int \frac {h^2} {2m} \psi^{*'} \psi^{'} + \psi^* (V-E) \psi dx = 0$$</p>

<p>$$\int \frac {h^2} {2m}\delta \psi^{*'} \psi^{'} + \delta \psi^* (V-E) \psi dx = 0$$</p>

<p>Integrating by parts:</p>

<p>$$\frac {h^2} {2m} \psi^{'} \delta \psi^{*}\Big{|}^b_a - \frac {h^2} {2m} \int  \psi^{''} \delta \psi^* dx + \int \delta \psi^* (V-E) \psi dx = 0$$</p>

<p>Since the variation $\delta \psi^*$ is an arbitrarily small function that goes to zero at the end points of $[a,b]$, let's make the added assumption that it's first and second derivatives also go to zero at the end points:</p>

<p>$$\int \Big[- \frac {h^2} {2m}  \psi^{''} + (V-E) \psi \Big] \delta \psi^* dx = 0$$</p>

<p>Again, since the variation $\delta \psi^*$ is arbitrary (but small), and zero at the end points, the fundamental theorem of variational calculus tells us that:</p>

<p>$$- \frac {h^2} {2m}  \psi^{''} + (V-E) \psi = 0$$</p>

<p>So far so good. Now if in the step where we did integration by parts, we changed the order, we would have got the following:</p>

<p>$$\frac {h^2} {2m} \delta \psi^{*'} \psi\Big{|}^b_a - \frac {h^2} {2m} \int \delta \psi^{*''} \psi dx + \int \delta \psi^* (V-E) \psi dx = 0$$</p>

<p>Our assumption about the derivatives of the variation in $\psi^*$ means that:</p>

<p>$$\int \Big[ -\frac {h^2} {2m} \delta \psi^{*''} + \delta \psi^* (V-E) \Big] \psi dx = 0$$</p>

<p>Now what we have in the square brackets is a function which is zero at the endpoints of $[a,b]$, and arbitrary in the middle (though small):</p>

<p>So it seems that the fundamental theorem of variations calculus implies:</p>

<p>$$\psi = 0$$</p>

<p>This obviously is untrue, as $\psi$ wasn't any particular wave function, and could be non-zero. So where am I going wrong.</p>

<p>We know that the action is correct; something we proved. It's just that changing the order of functions while integrating by parts gives us a dubious result. It might also be that since we limited the derivatives of $\delta \psi^*$ to zero at the end points, the fundamental theorem used might not be valid, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>$$\tau=xF_y-yF_x$$</p>

<p>He explained that radial distance, $\mathbf{r} = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, and force, $\mathbf{F}=\sqrt{F_x^2+F_y^2}$, are just two vectors and that any two vectors can be combined similarly to get a third resultant vector. Rather than try to represent the result on the same plane as the original vectors it makes organizational sense to represent the result in the third dimension, perpendicular to the original vectors. This is the cross product $\mathbf{c = a \times b}$: </p>

<p>$$c_x = a_y b_z - a_z b_y$$ 
$$c_y = a_z b_x - a_x b_z$$ 
$$c_z = a_x b_y - a_y b_x$$ </p>

<p>Glorious illumination! I had been trying for years to figure out why arbitrarily smooshing vector components together resulted in a vector sticking out of the blackboard somehow equivalent to simple torque. I now understand that the cross product is just a pseudo vector to represent two things that interact orthogonally.  </p>

<p>But I still don't feel 100% about about Feynman's original definition for torque. I followed the geometrical proof but I'm hoping there is a straightforward, intuitive, way to understand why

"271302","Why does finite size scaling shift the critical temperature downward?","<p>The question is in the title.</p>

<p>Say we have a system where:

<p>$$
L =|T_\text{finite size transition}-T_c(\infty)|^{-\nu}
$$</p>

<p>You can easily enough solve this and find the shifted transition temperature. I don't find this argument compelling, though. $\xi$ diverges on both sides of the transition temperature, so there seems to be just as good of an argument that the temperature should shift <em>up</em>, not down, since that is where the correlation length first reaches the sample size.</p>

"271314","Bare Cosmological Constant and Fine-Tuning Problem","<p>Whenever anyone talks about the cosmological constant, they usually cite the difference of $\approx 120$ orders of magnitude between the observed and calculated values for the vacuum energy ($\rho_\text{obs} \approx 10^{-8}\text{erg}/\text{cm}^3$ and $\rho_\text{calc} \approx 10^{112}\text{erg}/\text{cm}^3$) and then claim that this leads to a serious fine-tuning problem.  I've been trying to look into this, and, as best I can tell, the root of it appears to be that people claim that there is a bare cosmological constant: $$\Lambda_{\text{eff}} = \Lambda_{\text{bare}} + \Lambda_{\text{vac}}.$$ Where it appears that $\Lambda_\text{eff}$ is the ""actual"" cosmological constant that gets introduced into the Einstein Field Equations: $$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda_\text{eff}g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu},$$ $\Lambda_\text{vac}$ corresponds to the roughly calculated value of the vacuum energy from all of the zero-point energies, and $\Lambda_\text{bare}$ is the the bare cosmological constant. The claim is that in order to get the extremely small observed value, the bare constant must cancel the vacuum constant out to $120$ orders of magnitude, which is a pretty serious fine-tuning problem. </p>

<p>My question, then, is this: What is the nature of the bare cosmological constant? My understanding of the ""actual"" cosmological constant that enters the Einstein Field Equations is that it arises from the vacuum energy (I guess, in my mind, I've always thought $\Lambda_\text{eff} = \Lambda_\text{vac}$), which leaves me confused about where the bare constant comes from.  I've seen several papers make mention of the bare constant, but no one ever actually explains why it's present or how it is justified, so a reference would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!    </p>

"271325","Expression for the resonance fluorescence of a single atom with nonradiative decay","<p>I'm looking at the resonance fluorescence spectrum of single atoms, also know as the Mollow triplet. </p>

<p>To give a little bit of context, we are thinking about some (artificial) two level system, like a qubit or an atom. It has the a decay rate $\Gamma_1 = \gamma_r + \gamma_{nr}$ where $\gamma_r$ is the radiative and $\gamma_{nr}$ is the nonradiative decay rate (through whatever mechanism), and it has a pure dephasing rate $\gamma_\phi$; this implies  a decoherence rate $\Gamma_2 = 2\Gamma_1 + \gamma_\phi$.</p>

<p>Next we assume this atom is driven with a Rabi rate $\Omega$, which could for example be a laser. Given all this, one can get an explicit expression for the incoherent emission expected from the atom, known as the resonance fluorescence spectrum, under some mild assumptions.</p>

<p>Following <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4944.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4944.pdf</a>, if one has a strong drive $\Omega^2 &gt;&gt; \Gamma_1^2$ and one has no non-radiative decay $\eta = \frac{\gamma_{r}}{\gamma_{r}+\gamma_{nr}} = 1$, one can write that</p>

<p>\begin{equation}S(\omega) = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\frac{\hbar\omega\Gamma_1}{8}\left(\frac{\gamma_s}{(\delta\omega+\Omega)^2+\gamma_s^2} +\frac{2 \gamma_c}{\delta\omega^2+\gamma_c^2} + \frac{\gamma_s}{(\delta\omega-\Omega)^2+\gamma_s^2}\right)\end{equation}</p>

<p>where $\gamma_c = \Gamma_2$ and $\gamma_s = (\Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2)/2$, to stay in line with the paper.</p>

<p>My main question is how one would include $\eta \neq 1$ into this; a situation where the decay is not purely radiative. The paper itself does not offer an explicit derivation for the equation itself, and I assume it might be found in some standard textbooks, although that path hasn't worked out thus far. Initially I thought that perhaps one just adds the $\eta$ as a global prefactor, but I am not sure. Does it make sense that all of the dressed states are affected equally?</p>

<p>Next up is the condition of strong drive. I understand that one has to make an approximation at some point (not explicitly done in the paper), but for my purposes the strong drive is not ideal. What would the spectrum look like under weak drive $\Omega^2 &lt;&lt; \Gamma_1^2$, or even in the intermediate regime $\Omega \approx \Gamma_1$? I looked around in the literature but again, I could not find an explicit expression.</p>

The partition function $Z_0$ for $H_0$ can be solved using a transfer matrix:
\begin{align}Z_0&amp;=\text{Tr} \,e^{-\beta H_0}=\sum_{s^x_{j\tau_1},\cdots s^x_{j\tau_M}} e^{-\beta H_0(s_{j\tau_1}^x,s_{j\tau_2}^x)}\cdots e^{-\beta H_0(s_{j\tau_M}^x,s_{j\tau_1}^x)}\\

$$Z=\text{Tr}\, e^{-\beta H}=\text{Tr}\, e^{-\beta(H_0+H_1)}$$
Furthermore, suppose that I only know the bottom two eigenstates of $H_0'$, and that these are furthermore separated from the rest of the spectrum of $H_0'$ by a huge amount. Is there any way to write a reduced partition function

This is the function of the $E$ and $B$ field. (the exact formula is well known).
The magnitude of the $E$ and $B$ vector oscillates as the wave propagates - at some point both of them reaches its maximum (so $S=max$), at some point both of them are zero (so $S=0$).

"271365","Total angular momentum of the free Dirac field in terms of creation and annihilation operators","<p>When doing canonical quantization for the Dirac field, one typically begins by expanding the field into the following form:
$$\psi(x) = \int\frac{d^3\vec{p}}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^32E_\vec{p}}}\sum_{s}
\left\{a(\vec{p},s)u(\vec{p},s)e^{-ipx}+
b^\dagger(\vec{p},s)v(\vec{p},s)e^{ipx} \right\}, $$
where $u(\vec{p},s)e^{-ipx}$ and $v(\vec{p},s)e^{ipx}$ are positive and negative-energy plane wave solutions to the Dirac equation that are also helicity eigen-spinors with eigenvalue $s$. By imposing equal-time anti-commutation relation for the field operator and the canonical momentum, one arrives at fermionic anti-commutation relations satisfied by $a(\vec{p},s)$, $b(\vec{p},s)$ and their Hermitian conjugates, where they acquire physical meaning as creation and annihilation operators. </p>

<p>After introducing some wise definition of what vacuum means, one can write down the expression for the Hamiltonian, momentum and charge of the field in terms of these creation and annihilation operators. For instance, the expression for momentum reads
$$P^\mu = \int d^3\vec{p} \sum_{s}p^\mu[a^\dagger(\vec{p},s) a(\vec{p},s) + b^\dagger(\vec{p},s) b(\vec{p},s)].$$</p>

<p>However, when it comes to angular momentum, textbooks seem to be only willing to give it in terms of $\psi(x)$, i.e.,
$$M_{\mu\nu} = \int d^3x~\psi^\dagger(x)\left[i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]\psi(x),$$
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is the set of matrices that control the behavior of the Dirac spinor under Lorentz transformation. I know that the above expression is a special case of a more general formula that come from Noether's theorem, and I am wondering if there is a neat expression for $M_{\mu\nu}$ in terms of $a(\vec{p},s)$, $b(\vec{p},s)$ and their Hermitian conjugates. I tried to substitute in the expansion of $\psi(x)$, but it did not lead me very far. In particular, since there is a derivative operator sandwiched between the spinors $u$ and $v$, I was not able to apply orthogonal relations, and cannot see how to proceed. </p>

<p><strong>So my question is: Is there a neat expression for the total angular momentum $M_{\mu\nu}$ of the free Dirac field $\psi(x)$ in terms of creation and annihilation operators $a(\vec{p},s),~a^\dagger(\vec{p},s),~b(\vec{p},s),b^\dagger(\vec{p},s)$?

<p><hr>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> For those who might be interested, here is what I have found following @Numrok 's answer: $$M_{\mu\nu} = \int d^3\vec{p}\sum_{s,s'}\left\{
\frac{a^\dagger(\vec{p},s')u^\dagger(\vec{p},s')}{\sqrt{2E_\vec{p}}}
\left[i\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\nu}p_\mu-\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\mu}p_\nu\right)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]
\frac{a(\vec{p},s)u(\vec{p},s)}{\sqrt{2E_\vec{p}}}
 +\frac{b^\dagger(\vec{p},s')v^T(\vec{p},s')}{\sqrt{2E_\vec{p}}}\left[i\left(p_\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\nu}-p_\nu\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\mu}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^T_{\mu\nu}\right]\frac{b(\vec{p},s)v^*(\vec{p},s)}{\sqrt{2E_\vec{p}}} 
\right\}.$$
Where ${\partial}/{\partial p^0}$ should be taken as zero, and all ${\partial}/{\partial p^i}$ with $i$ being a spatial index will act on any $p^0 = E_\vec{p}$ to the right of it. (I am using the $+,-,-,-$ signature.)  Not sure if this is the simplest form because it still seems a bit complicated to me.

"271374","Why does this trick for elastic collision with rotation work?","<p>When revising for a general physics paper in my master course we had to go back and do all these standard collision problems. One frequent question is of the following form: A body with some mass distribution (usually a thin rod of length $L$ and mass $M$) has velocity $v_0$. It then hits a stationary spike that is held in place (e.g. fixed to the earth) at a distance $d$ from its centre of mass. The collision is fully elastic. The exercise is then to calculate the CoM velocity and rotation speed after the collision.</p>

<p>A standard solution to this is to set up two equations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>angular momentum conservation</strong> about the axis perpendicular to $v_0$ and through the collision point</li>
<li><strong>energy conservation</strong> of the rod, since the collision is elastic and the spike is held in place, i.e. the rod's energy does not change</li>
</ul>

<p>A friend of mine then (either by ingenious intuition or by remembering it from our dynamics course) claimed that angular momentum conservation (which can be slightly annoying to write down) can be <strong>replaced by the following condition: the velocity in the spike frame of the point on the rod that touches the spike is reversed.</strong></p>

<p>To my surprise it worked for the specific question we were doing, we got the same result using both calculations. Now my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this actually true for inelastic collisions in general or some kind of coincidence? I haven't tried to prove it, but I think if it is true that should be straightforward. This is not my main question though, since I believe it is probably true in general.</li>
<li>Now assuming that it is true: <strong>Why on earth is it true??</strong> As in: is there an easy explanation or does it just come out of the math? The reason I find this so astonishing is that angular momentum conservation and energy conservation apply <em>globally</em> and it is important that the rod is a <strong>rigid body</strong>. It seems amazing to me that one can replace that by a simple and completely <em>local</em> condition, that tells you how <em>one point</em> of the rigid body will move.</li>

<p>My line of reasoning was this: Using the decay equation $ N(t) = N_0e^{-\lambda t} $ and the relationship $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln{2}}{\lambda} $ I could compute the decay constant $\lambda$.</p>

<p>With an initial gram of caesium, it has an atomic mass of $\mu = 137 g/mol$, 1 gram of caesium contains $\frac{1}{137} mol$ and therefore $\frac{1}{137} \cdot N_A$ particles which means $N_0 = 4.4 \cdot 10^{21}$ nuclei.
After one second $3.215 \cdot 10^{12}$ nuclei would decay as per the specific activity and therefore $N(1) = N_0 - 3.215 \cdot 10^{12} = N_0 e^{-\lambda}$. After calculations $e^{-\lambda} = \frac{4.39 \cdot 10^{21}}{4.4 \cdot 10^{21}}$ which gives $\lambda = 0.0022$ and $t_{1/2} = 315 s$ which is obviously wrong since the half-life is around 30 years for this isotope. </p>

"271395","Power and radiance scaling in Coherent Beam Combination","<p>Generally, it's said that for incoherent laser beam combining, the intensity scales with N (where N = # of lasers), whereas the intensity scales with $N^2$ for coherent combining.<br>
$$I_{array,incoherent}=N*I_{single}$$<br>
$$I_{array,coherent}=N^2*I_{single}$$<br>
 Why? Because in coherent combining, the amplitudes add up, and the intensity scales with the square of the amplitude.</p>

<p>However, things seema bit more nuanced and I feel like I've read some confusing info while delving deeper into the theory, which I'll elaborate on below. Imagine two methods of coherent combining:</p>

<p>Method A -->  ""Side-by-side"", or ""tiled"", combining. N lasers are placed in an array with fill factor 1, all in phase.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzowc.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzowc.png"" alt=""Tiled combining""></a></p>

<p>Method B --> ""Filled-aperture"" combining. N lasers are combined using 50/50 beamsplitters and using the 100% constructive interference from one output when the phase is just right.
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/28KFP.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/28KFP.png"" alt=""Filled-aperture combining""></a></p>

<p>What I don't understand stems from the following paper:
<a href=""https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/Fan_LaserBeamCombining.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/Fan_LaserBeamCombining.pdf</a>
states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another way to look
  at the nonideality of CBC systems is to recognize that, for the
  ideal phasing of an array of N elements, the on-axis far-field
  intensity will be N times higher than for the same array with no
  fixed phase relations (incoherent) among the elements [3]. This can be simply understood by recognizing that the radiance of the incoherent array is at best that of a single element and that an ideally phased system will have a radiance of N times this amount.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that if the far-field intensity is a factor N higher for incoherent combining (compared to a single source), it should be $N*N=N^2$ higher for coherent combining. Directly after, it reads</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a note, it has been often stated that the on-axis intensity of
  CBC systems scales as $N^2$ (e.g., see [4]), which appears to be
  at odds with the stated brightness scaling. The on-axis intensity
  does scale as $N^2$, <em>but only if the emitting aperture grows proportional
  to N.</em> If instead the aperture size is constrained to a fixed
  size, then the on-axis intensity scales only as N.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For method A (tiled), I can see how the emitting aperture grows (due to the array) and that the intensity scales indeed with $N^2$. However, for method B (filled-aperture), one of the characteristics is that the aperture size remains constant. </p>

<p><strong>Then, does this indeed mean that using this coherent combining method, you'll really only get a factor N rather than $N^2$ higher intensity?</strong><br>
(If so, what happened to the square of the amplitude? Is there any way to increase the area to get the $N^2$ dependency?)</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>Some considerations that I felt fit not in the question, but might be useful:</p>

<p>For Method A, I'd say the total beam power scales with N (lasers). Due to the reduced divergence, the final on-axis intensity then scales with $N^2$. (One factor N due to the nr of lasers, one due to the reduced divergence)  </p>

<p>For Method B, I'd say the total beam intensity scales with $N^2$ (lasers, constructive interference) and the divergence is unaffected, resulting also in an on-axis intensity of $N^2$, rather than the N suggested above.
Extra: If the intensity ($W/m^2$) scales with $N^2$ increases, and the beam area remains the same, I'd still expect an $N^2$ dependency for the power as well, even though you can't 'make' extra power?</p>

Also assume that both the operators have their own eigenstates that span $H$(existence of eigenbasis). Now, we take their commutator: $[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A}$. We could now have three scenarios :</p>

<ol>
<li>$[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=0$</li>
<li>$[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\neq0$ </li>
<li>There exist a null space(dimensionality >=1) of $[\hat{A},\hat{B}]$ which is a <em>proper subspace</em> of the underlying Hilbert space</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to analyse each case separately and get some idea about the <strong>nature of eigenstates</strong>, <strong>degeneracy</strong> and <strong>simultaneous solutions</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Analysis of 1</strong></p>

<p>In the first case, the commutator takes any state vector $\left|\psi\right&gt; \in H $ to $0$. So, if we apply the commutator on $\left|\psi\right&gt;=\left|a\right&gt;$($\left|a\right&gt;$ being an eigenvector of $\hat{A}$), we get:
$$\hat{B}\hat{A}\left|a\right&gt;=a\hat{B}\left|a\right&gt;=\hat{A}(\hat{B}\left|a\right&gt;)$$
The second equality gives: $\hat{B}\left|a\right&gt;$ as an eigenvector of $\hat{A}$ with eigenvalue a. </p>

<p>Further, we can have two more subcases:</p>

<p>a. $\hat{B}\left|a\right&gt;=b\left|a\right&gt;$ $\rightarrow$ This is a kind of <em>redundant</em> case where $\hat{B}\left|a\right&gt;$ is no new eigenfunction of $\hat{A}$. Instead we can now say we have $\left|a\right&gt;$ as a <em>simultaneous eigenfunction</em> of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$.</p>

<p>b. $\hat{B}\left|a\right&gt;=\left|c\right&gt;$ $\rightarrow$ This means we have <em>two linearly independent eigenvectors</em> of $\hat{A}$(namely,$\left|a\right&gt;$ and $\left|c\right&gt;$) with the <em>same eigenvalue</em>.(<em>degeneracy</em> of order two).</p>

<p>Mathematically, we cannot gain any other insight.So I find the following statement erronous.</p>

<p>Two commuting operators give rise simultaneous eigenfunctions.</p>

<p>Since, we donot know about the existence of simultaneous solutions, we could probably say:</p>

<p>Two commuting operators <em>admit</em> simultaneous eigenfunctions.(we donot know about their existence)</p>

<p>Also, I think its fine to say that <strong>commutability is a necessary condition for existence of simultaneous eigenfunctions but not a sufficient condition</strong>.(as my working clearly shows)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Analysis of 2</strong></p>

<p>Here, there exists no state vector $\left|\psi\right&gt;$ for which $\left([\hat{A},\hat{B}]\right)\left|\psi\right&gt;=0$. This means that the existence of a simultaneous  eigenfunction will directly contradict the given <em>global non-commutativity</em>(here by global I am distinguishing case 2 from case 3 of the previously outlined scenarios). </p>

<p>Hence, this case means <em>absolutely</em> no common eigenfunctions.</p>

<p>In addition, there an interesting situation here. We now have a new non-null  operator(namely, the commutator)which will have its own eigenstates and eigenvalues. <strong>If anyone can shed light on the properties of these eigenstates and their relation with eigenstates of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, it would be nice</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Analysis of 3</strong></p>

<p>I have never come across anywhere talk about this case, but I have a hunch it might bear some relevance. Here are my ideas.</p>

<p>This situation exposes a new direction that I think must be understood first.</p>

<p>In analysis 1, we conclude about the existence of degeneracy or simultaneous eigenstates by letting the commutator act on an eigenvector of $\hat{A}$ or $\hat{B}$. We are <strong>not checking for the action of the commutator on anything but an eigenstate</strong>. Yes, action of eigenstate is known to us, <strong>but what about the information derivable from its action on other state vectors?</strong> They might also contain some information that is not related to the simultaneity/degeneracy of eigenstates of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$.Anyways, <strong>we don't bother as atleast all eigenvectors go to zero</strong>.</p>

<p>Here, <strong>not all eigenvectors will go to zero</strong>. Then, we have as a proper subspace of $H$ as the null space of the commutator.The classification of simultaneous solution or degeneracies will now only work for a subset of the basis of $H$. What about the other eigenvectors?(in the sense, <strong>what conclusion can one draw about the connection between the eigenbasis of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ due to this</strong>)?</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is evident in its analysis and how one can completely describe this situation considering all possible cases.Yet for a quick look my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What information can we extract about the relation between the eigenbasis of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ from the commutation relation when we look at their(meaning the commutator) action on <em>non-eigenvectors</em>?(Analysis 1 and 3)</li>
<li>What is the relation between the three eigenbasis (namely, $\hat{A},\hat{B},[\hat{A},\hat{B}]$) in the 2nd case(when commutator is non-zero)?(Analysis 2)</li>
</ol>

<p>Apart from the answer to the explicitly mentioned questions, comments on my analysis and further insights will be greatly useful.</p>

"271419","Why is there this relationship between quaternions and Pauli matrices?","<p>I've just started studying quantum mechanics, and I've come across this correlation between Pauli matrices ($\sigma_i$) and quaternions which I can't grasp: namely, that $i\sigma_1$, $i\sigma_2$ and $i\sigma_3$, along with the 2x2 identity matrix $I$, correspond identically to the four 2x2 matrix representation of unit quaternions.</p>

<p>My first guess was that this should have something to do with quaternions being useful for representing orientations and rotations of objects in three dimensions and Pauli matrices being related to the three spatial components of spin, but I didn't really know how to put together those two ideas. Google wasn't much help either: the relation is mentioned, for instance, in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Quaternions"">this Wikipedia article</a>, but no further explanation is given.</p>

"271423","Principle of Least Action: Electrostatics","<p>I am reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics about the <a href=""http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_19.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Principle of Least Action</a>. During this lecture (around 3/4th of the page), Dr. Feynman formulated the electrostatics problem as:</p>

<p>\begin{equation*}
U\star=\frac{\epsilon}{2}\int(\nabla{\phi})^2\,dV-
\int\rho\phi\,dV,
\end{equation*}</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_08.html"" rel=""nofollow"">one of his previous lectures</a>, I understand that the first integral refers to the energy at a certain location due to electric field (eqn. 8.35). </p>

<p>As for the second integral, it should refer to the potential energy gained by bringing charges to their current locations (eqn. 8.28). </p>

<p>However, eqn. 8.28 had a 1/2 factor to account for double counting the forces between a pair of charges.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why does this factor disappear from the formulation of the electrostatics Principle of Least Action problem?</p>

<p><strong>Equations Mentioned</strong></p>

<p>Eqn 8.28 - $$U = \frac {1}{2} \int \rho \phi d V \tag{8.28}$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This equation can be interpreted as follows. The potential energy of the charge ρdVρdV is the product of this charge and the potential at the same point. The total energy is therefore the integral over ϕρdVϕρdV. But there is again the factor 1212. It is still required because we are counting energies twice. The mutual energies of two charges is the charge of one times the potential at it due to the other. Or, it can be taken as the second charge times the potential at it from the first. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eqn 8.35 - $$U = \frac {\epsilon_0}{2} \int\limits_{all space} (\nabla \phi) * (\nabla \phi) d V = \frac {\epsilon_0}{2} \int\limits_{all space} E * E d V\tag{8.35}$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We see that it is possible for us to represent the energy of any charge distribution as being the integral over an energy density located in the field.</p>

"271429","Successive work functions for solid-state metals","<p>I was wondering if there are tables for successive work functions for (solid state) metals? All I can find are work functions to remove 1 electron from the surface of a metal into vacuum (and to keep it there). However, I guess it gets harder to remove electrons the more electrons already have been removed, right?</p>

<p>Maybe there's a way to relate the work function to the average degree of ionization of the material... do you know if that is possible at all?
I've heard about the Thomas-Fermi approximation which relates the mean degree of ionization to the electron-temperature and electron-density but that seems to be rather inaccurate.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd like to know your opinion: Is it harder to ionize a metal gas or a metal solid? Although most work functions are a little bit smaller than the (1st) ionization-energies of the same material in gaseous state but I still think ionization of solids is harder. Do you agree?</p>

"271442","Can we expect to relate the fundamental constants G and c?","<p>Newton's gravitational constant G tells us about the strength of the static gravitational interaction within our spacetime. The speed of light c can be derived from the properties of spacetime itself, and in some sense describes the ""stiffness"" of the medium which is spacetime. From here we can derive, together with GR, a complete description of the propagation of gravitational waves. There are, therefore, multiple conceptual ways in which G and c interrelate when describing events unfolding upon the stage of curved spacetime. It seems therefore curious that G and c are not somehow related via some wider and deeper conceptual framework.</p>

"271444","Is gravity due to the curvature of spacetime?","<p>Having looked at this question online, multiple sources overwhelmingly support the statement that 'Gravity results from the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy'.

<p>So, is the above statement correct, or not? If not, then can it be corrected, or should it be completely disregarded? I cannot see how the curvature of space-time and gravity cannot be related, as gravity and curvature are both linked to the mass of an object. For example, a black hole results in massive curvature of space-time, and the gravitational forces are also massive. </p>

<p>If the processes is reversible (that is I can write $d W= p dV$) I have no problem in saying that</p>

<ul>
<li>In a isochoric process $W=0$, since $dV=0$.</li>
<li>In a isobaric process $W=p(V_b-V_a)$ since $\int p dV=p \int dV$.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, in both cases I can be sure that work is a state function (and, in particular, in isochoric is zero).</p>

<p>The problem is: I find in different textbooks that the previous expression for $W$ are used also in the cases of <strong>irreversible</strong> processes.</p>

<p>But in my view this is not correct because, to reach those conclusions about work it is fundamental to use $d W= p dV$, which holds true iff the process is  reversible.</p>

<p>So are the previous relations correctly or incorrectly used in the case of irreveresibility? </p>

<p>If so, can you suggest me any book/source that talks about canonical processes (isobaric, isochoric in particular) without saying that for <strong>any</strong> isochoric and isobaric process (irreversible or not) the previous ones are the expressions of work?</p>

"271472","Should we stop saying that nothing can escape the event horizon of a black hole post LIGO?","<p>Now that LIGO has demonstrated that two black holes can burp large amounts of energy (in the form of gravitational radiation) in the process of consuming each other, shouldn't we stop saying that nothing can escape the event horizon of a black hole.  Clearly, some of the mass energy that was observed in the LIGO experiment was confined by the event horizons of the two black holes prior to their merger.  Somehow, in the transition from two separate event horizons to a single event horizon there was opened an escape route (if only for a short time).</p>

<p>The problem is that if we accept that all points on the critical surfaceare critical in the manner that their corresponding correlation length is infinite, then according to scaling hypothesis a system whose parameters lie on the critical surface should be scale invariant. And therefore it's parameters shouldn't change under the RG transformation. So each point on the critical surface should be a fixed point and hence there is not any RG flow over the critical surface. It implies that the RG transformation doesn't push any point on the critical surface to our first fixed point. </p>

"271482","What is the experimental basis for using the speed-of-light, $c,$ as the maximum speed in the universe?","<p>Doppler effect, mass changes of objects, and all relativistic effects (v^2/c^2) are based on $c$ as the maximum velocity ($Vt$) in the Universe. We have a fairly good understanding of relativity (I will stop at SR). If $Vt$ was only slightly higher than $c$ (say 0.001%), then certain conflicts in physics could be resolved. For example, photons could then have a very insignificant rest mass, which would then match all the other photon physical characteristics and properties. </p>

<p>Therefore <strong>my question is</strong> - What is the experimental and/ or measured data for setting that ultimate velocity limit? Keep in mind that assuming 'nothing goes faster than the speed of light' is not what I am asking as it is generally agreed that we have not seen anything yet.

<p>All others Christoffel symbols seem to be zero.</p>

<p>Now, I can write the geodesics equation with :</p>

<p>$\dfrac{d^{2}u^{i}}{ds^{2}} + \Gamma_{jk}^{i}\dfrac{du^{j}}{ds}\dfrac{du^{k}}{ds}$</p>

<p>$\dfrac{d^{2}\theta}{ds^{2}} = -\dfrac{dr}{ds}\dfrac{d\theta}{ds}\,\,\,(2)$</p>

<p>By make appearing the logarithmic derivate : $\dfrac{d\,ln(u)}{ds}=\dfrac{u'}{u}$, I have :</p>

<p>for (2) : $\dfrac{\theta'}{\theta} = - \dfrac{dr}{ds} ; \dfrac{d\theta}{ds} = e^{-r}$</p>

<p>Finally, I have for (2): $\theta(s)=s\,e^{-r}$</p>

<p>for (1), taking $\theta(s)=s\,e^{-r}$, I have :</p>

<p>$\dfrac{d^{2}r}{ds^{2}} = \bigg(\dfrac{d\theta}{ds}\bigg)^{2} = e^{-2r}$</p>

<p>Finally, we get for (1) : $r(s)=\dfrac{s^{2}}{2}e^{-2r} = \dfrac{1}{2}\theta^{2}$</p>

<p>By using results from (1) and (2), I could write :</p>

<p>$r=\theta^{2}/2$</p>

<p>I don't understand this result knowing $s$ may be choose as a linear parameter or curvilinear (like the length on the geodesics). </p>

"272522","Would setting a magnetic base to the ""off"" position remove the torque from an external field?","<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_base"" rel=""nofollow"">magnetic base</a> is a permanent magnet mostly inside a ferromagnetic case. It can be rotated so that the field is either internally shunted through the ferromagnetic blocks, or so that the blocks are excited and polarized, producing a strong external magnetic field that can hold strongly to an external ferromagnetic surface like a steel bench or housing of a piece of equipment.</p>

<p>If it is set to ""on"" and not stuck to anything, it will have a strong external dipole moment, and <em>I believe</em> it will experience a substantial torque if there is an external uniform magnetic field.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> If it is set to ""off"" when there is minimal external field, would this substantially minimize the torque from an external uniform field? <em>What is the underlying physics here</em> - do I need to carefully treat the field inside the steel and permanent magnet, or just the part of the field ""outside"" the device to understand the main effect of ""on"" vs ""off"" on the possible torque?</p>

<p>Because even the torque on a magnet can usually be nulled at certain angles, assume this is repeated at a variety of angles.</p>

<p>I'm using the magnetic base as a real-world example, but my question is really about a macroscopic block of permanent magnet magnetized uniformly, and any kind of ferromagnetic material - used vs not used - as a ""keeper"" or shunt. Assume the material is linear and very high permeability to keep the problem simple.</p>

Calculate the velocity of a block with mass X$kg$, when it is struck by a bullet of mass Y$kg$ travelling at Z$m/s$. The block is initially at rest and the bullet embeds into the block during the collision.</p>

<p>To solve this we usually find the momentum of the bullet $(Pkg/m/s = Ykg * Zm/s)$ and then find the velocity of the block/bullet combination by reversing it: $(Am/s = Pkg/m/s / (X+Y)kg)$.</p>

"272554","Time for Two Reservoirs that are Connected with a Porous Medium to Equilibrate","<p>I'm trying to calculate the time for the liquid in two connected reservoirs (open to the air) to equilibrate.  The tricky part is the connecting region, which consists of a porous medium. I understand that without the porous medium, I can apply Torricelli's law to account for the change of pressure head over time. However, Torricelli's law doesn't apply to flow through porous medium. I also understand that I can apply Darcy approximation for flow through a porous medium. But Darcy law doesn't take into account for the change in pressure term in the equation.</p>

<p>What I have tried:</p>

<p>1) I tried derive the solution by combining Torricelli's law and Darcy law. But the solution turned out to be weird where I get t = Constant* ln(ΔH) where the Constant consists of area of reservoir, cross sectional area of opening, permeability of the porous medium, length, viscosity, density, gravitational force. So this method failed.  </p>

<p>2) I tried looking for unsteady flow solution for Darcy equation. Turned out that there are a few ways such as VANS approximation, Virtual Mass approximation and Volume-average energy equation. To be honest, I failed to follow through the whole process of derivation and I also realized that the solution which the paper provided may not be what I have been looking for. The unsteady state flow that they describe is the initial fluctuation of velocity profile but not a change due to decreasing pressure head.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I proceed to calculate the time for the two reservoirs to equilibrate?</p>

<p>Known parameters:
- Initial ΔH
- Permeability of the porous column (assumed to be a constant throughout)
- Area of reservoir
- Cross-sectional area of connecting part
- Viscosity
- Density
- Length</p>

  <p>We have seen earlier in this chapter that the Wightman functions $$W(x_1,...,x_n) = ⟨Ω,φ(x_1)···φ(x_n)Ω⟩$$
  can be used to completely reconstruct a scalar bosonic field theory. These functions, as it turns out, can be analytically continued to the so-called Schwinger points $z_j = (ix^0_j , x^1_j , x^2_j , x^3_j )$, provided the points $x_j ∈ \mathscr{R}^4$ are such that $x_j\ne x_j$ if $j\ne k$. The map $(\mathbb{R}^4)^n → (i\mathbb{R}×\mathbb{R}^3)^n$ given by $(x_1,x_2 ...,x_n)  → (z_1,z_2,...,z_n)$ is called a <em>Wick rotation</em>. The functions

"272574","Anisotropic charge screening and the rate of spontaneous fission","<p>Fast electrons that pass by a heavy nucleus have a cross section for being deflected from their course, giving rise to bremsstrahlung.

In the limit, the electron is completely stopped and its kinetic energy converted to a photon.</p>

<p>Spontaneous fission and alpha decay are quantum mechanical tunneling processes that are very sensitive to the width of the Coulomb barrier through which a decay daughter must tunnel.

I only remembered it recently, I have no idea how to solve it, and it irks me.</p>

<p>Say we have a Schwartzschild black hole, and a small, massive particle at some spacetime point inside the event horizon. We have done several calculaions on this scenario during class. For instance that a free fall maximizes the eigentime until the particle hits the singularity, so I'm at least somewhat familiar with it. However, those calculations involved calculating $\left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2$ and taking the square root. At no point did we show that $\frac{dr}{d\tau}$ is actually negative, i.e. that the particle will experience falling <em>towards</em> the center of the black hole.</p>

"272598","Inconsistency in regularization with parallel and perpendicular momenta","<p>In deriving the axial anomaly Peskin and Schroeder use dimensional regularization, continuing loop momenta to $ 4 - \epsilon $ dimenstions. The loop momenta can now be split into pieces ``parallel'' to $ d = 0,1,2,3 $ and those ""perpendicular"" to $ d = 0,1,2,3  $,
$$
\ell = \ell _{ \parallel } + \ell _{ \perp } 
$$
Furthermore, they define $ \gamma ^5 $ as,
$$
\gamma ^5 \equiv i \gamma ^0 \gamma ^1 \gamma ^2 \gamma ^3 
$$
with this definition $ \gamma ^5 $ commutes with $ \gamma ^{ \mu } $ in the extra dimensions and so,
$$
\require{cancel}
P _L {\cancel \ell}  _{ \parallel } = {\cancel \ell}  _{ \parallel } P _R \hspace{1.5cm}P _L {\cancel \ell}  _{ \perp  } = {\cancel \ell}  _{ \perp  } P _L  
$$
I have no problem with the results in this section which are presented when trying to compute the axial anomaly for a vector theory. </p>

<p>However, if I try to apply this technique to computing the chiral gauge anomaly for three left-handed vertices I am getting the wrong answer. Peskin and Schroeder only remark on the the final result here. The issue arises from the triangle diagram in figure 19.9 will be proportional to,
$$
\require{cancel}
\text{Tr} \left[ \gamma ^\mu P _L ( {\cancel \ell} - {\cancel k} ) \gamma ^\lambda P _L {\cancel \ell} \gamma ^\nu P _L ( {\cancel \ell}  + {\cancel p} ) \right] 
$$
which after splitting the loop momenta gives,
$$
\require{cancel}
\text{Tr} \left[ \gamma ^\mu P _L ( {\cancel \ell} _{ \parallel } + {\cancel \ell} _\perp  - {\cancel k} ) \gamma ^\lambda P _L ( {\cancel \ell} _{ \parallel } + {\cancel \ell} _{ \perp  } )  \gamma ^\nu P _L ( {\cancel \ell} _{ \parallel } + {\cancel \ell} _{ \perp  }   + {\cancel p} ) \right] 
$$
Now if we carry through the projectors since $ P _L {\cancel \ell} _\perp P _R = 0 $ there won't be terms left with two factors of $ \ell _{ \perp } $, which are necessary to generate the anomaly. Since this should be anomalous something has gone wrong! </p>

<p>The strategy employed here is somewhat different then what the book suggests to do for this computation below equation 19.130:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The gauge boson vertices also contain factors of $ ( 1 - \gamma ^5 ) /2$. 
  The three projectors can be moved together into a single factor.
  Then, if we regularize this diagram as in Section 19.2, the term
  containing a $ \gamma ^5 $ has an axial anomaly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the book proposes to move around the projectors and only THEN employ the regularization procedure. Indeed in doing this I can get the correct result. However, this is a strange approach since it suggests working with an ill-defined integral, massaging the expression with strategies which are wrong with the later chosen regularization scheme, and then regularizing the expression.</p>

for some state vector $| \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$. We also have the state vector $| \psi \rangle$ in the position basis given by $\psi(y) = \langle y | \psi \rangle$. Then 
\begin{align}
(\hat{X} \psi)(y) &amp; := \langle y | \hat{X}| \psi \rangle = \int dx \langle y | x \rangle x \langle x | \psi \rangle = \int dx \delta(y-x)x \psi(x)

As I understand, one postulate of QM states that for any observable $\hat{A}$ we have that $$\hat{A} | \psi \rangle = a_n | \psi_n\rangle\tag{3}$$ where $a_n$ is some eigenvalue and $| \psi_n \rangle$ the corresponding eigenvector. For the position operator we thus have $$\hat{X} | \psi \rangle = x |x \rangle\tag{4}$$ where $x$ is some eigenvalue and $| x \rangle$ is the eigenvector of the position operator, therefore $$\langle y | \hat{X} | \psi \rangle = x \langle y | x \rangle = y \delta(y -x).\tag{5}$$ Therefore $$y\psi(y) = y\delta(y-x).\tag{6}$$ But then this implies that the state which we started with $| \psi \rangle$ is $$\psi(y) = \delta(y-x),\tag{7}$$ but this should be the state only after the position measurement.

<p>The classical thermodynamic entropy $S$ is related to heat $Q$ and absolute temperature $T$:</p>

"272680","How much power and energy is (actually) in a 230 dB ""click"" from a whale?","<p>In the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p042smrc"" rel=""nofollow"">BBC Science in Action</a> podcast the acoustic power of a 1 millisecond ""click"" from a whale was said to be 230 dB. The related <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160331-the-worlds-loudest-animal-might-surprise-you"" rel=""nofollow"">BBC article</a> mentions this number and elaborates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The blue whale is not the loudest animal on Earth, despite what you may have learned in school. While its calls are claimed to be louder than a jet engine at take-off, clocking in at an impressive 188 decibels (dB), the sperm whale is actually louder: its communicative clicks have been measured at 230 dB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I use the following equation <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/intens.html"" rel=""nofollow"">from here</a>;</p>

<p>$$I(dB)=10log_{10}\frac{I}{I_0} $$</p>

<p>rearrange it, </p>

<p>$$I= I_0 \ 10^{I(dB)/10} $$</p>

<p>and plug in the value of 10<sup>-12</sup> watts/m<sup>2</sup> given there and use a nominal area of 1 m<sup>2</sup>, I get 10<sup>23-12</sup> =  10<sup>11</sup>  watts/m<sup>2</sup>! So, if the duration of the ""click"" is 1 millisecond, that's 100 MJ of energy. It's not surprising then that it can also use acoustic pulses to disable or stun potential prey.</p>

<p>But the article goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This record raises another important point about loudness. Decibels in water are not equivalent to decibels in air. ""Water is denser than air, so sound travels through it differently – the speed of sound is different,"" says bio-acoustics expert <a href=""http://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/windmilljamesdr/"" rel=""nofollow"">James Windmill</a> from the University of Strathclyde in the UK, who discovered the water boatman's remarkable call.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this is somehow related to sound pressure vs intensity;  <em>force/area</em> versus <em>power/area</em>. Water is roughly 1000x as dense as air.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am not sure if I should be using this 61 dB offset in my calculation above. Is the energy of the ""click"" still 100 MJ?</p>

"272682","Potential due to an infinitely long charged wire","<p>It is easy to calculate the electric field $E$ of a infinite charged wire from a distance $r$ away from it. It is simply
$$\boldsymbol{E}=\frac{\lambda\boldsymbol{\hat{r}}}{2\pi\epsilon_0r}.$$
If I use this result to calculate the potential, I get
$$\phi(r)=-\int\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}s=-\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\ln r.$$
But if I use the Coulomb law (in its potential form) to integrate the potential of all charges in the wire I see that the integral diverges. This doesn't seem wrong because the potential was defined zero at infinity and the charge itself extends to infinity. But when we calculated the electric field we used the Coulomb law, so isn't the potential $-\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\ln r$ defined to be zero at infinity too? (I know it isn't simply because $\lim_{r\to\infty}\phi(r)=\infty$, but I don't know why.)</p>

"272684","What is the rigorous mathematical underpinning of Schwinger's quantum action principle?","<p>I'm reading J. Schwinger's book ""Quantum Kinematics and Dynamics"" and I'm trying to make sense of his formulation of his famous quantum action principle. In essence, he starts from considering <em>arbitrary</em> variations of the the quantum amplitude $\langle a, t_1 |b, t_2 \rangle$, where $|a, t_1 \rangle$ is an eigenvector, corresponding to eigenvalue $a$, of some arbitrary but fixed Hermitian operator $A(t_1)$ (considered in the Heisenberg picture of QM), and $|b, t_2 \rangle$ is an eigenvector, corresponding to eigenvalue $b$, of another arbitrary but fixed Hermitian operator $B(t_2)$. An <em>arbitrary</em> variation of the amplitude reads, obviously, $$ \delta (\langle a, t_1 |b, t_2 \rangle)= (\delta\langle a, t_1 |)|b, t_2 \rangle + \langle a, t_1 |(\delta |b, t_2 \rangle) $$ where $\delta\langle a, t_1 |$ and $\delta |b, t_2 \rangle$ are <em>arbitrary</em> variations of the eigenbra and eigenket.</p>

<p>Now comes the puzzle. Schwinger writes $$\delta |b, t_2 \rangle = -iG_b(t_2)|b, t_2 \rangle$$$$\delta\langle a, t_1 | = iG_a(t_1)\langle a, t_1 |$$where he says $G_a(t_1)$ and $G_b(t_2)$ are infinitesimal <em>Hermitian</em> operators. I don't understand as to why an <em>arbitrary</em> infinitesimal variation $\delta |b, t_2 \rangle$ should be generated by a <em>Hermitian</em> operator, as if <em>only unitary</em> infinitesimal variations (instead of <em>general</em> ones) are considered, and not by a more general operator. </p>

<p>Could you, please, help clarify as to why the generators must be Hermitian for the most general variation $\delta |b, t_2 \rangle$?</p>

If a pick a point in the middle of the floor, I can say that at the starting point the bullet is at a 170 degree angle, for example, from that reference point.

  B) Find the angular momentum of this brick about a horizontal axis through the fulcrum and perpendicular to the plane of the figure the instant before it strikes the seesaw.</p>

<p>Now $a_n = R\omega^2$, hence $a_n = 1*2^2= 4ms^{-2}= a_{total}$.

"272715","Force on charged plates (not exactly a capacitor)","<p>I am trying to connect my understanding of electrostatics in terms of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Coulomb force"">Coulomb force</a> to a thinking in field energies and potentials.</p>

<p>For example, let us consider a parallel-plate capacitor whose plates are charged to $+Q$ and $-Q$, respectively. Intuitively, these plates should attract each other because of the Coulomb force between opposite charges. We can also understand this by looking at the energy stored in the capacitor, i.e. its electric field:
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}
$$
with energy $E$, voltage $V$, and capacitance $C$.
For an ideal parallel-plate capacitor, the capacitance is
$$
C = \varepsilon \frac{A}{d}
$$
with the plate area $A$ and the distance $d$ separating the plates.
With this we can deduce that the capacitance will decrease with an increasing separation $d$. Hence, the energy will also decrease if the voltage is held constant and will increase if the charge is held constant.
So for the case of charged plates not connected to a voltage supply the latter case has to be applied and it follows that the plates attract each other to minimize the field energy.
If I understand it correctly, you could also calculate the force quantitatively by taking the spatial derivative of the field energy.</p>

<p>Now for the question which I still don't quite understand: Let's assume that the two plates considered above have arbitrary charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Intuitively, with the Coulomb force in mind, we should find a repulsive force for equally signed charges and an attractive one for opposite charges.
Is there a way to make an argument in terms of field energies and/or voltages to prove that?</p>

<p>I think that the voltage between the two plates alone is not adequate to describe the problem. Consider equally charged plates $Q_1 = Q_2 = Q$ (like in an electroscope). The potiential difference/voltage between the two plates has to be zero, simply for symmetry reasons. (The work needed to move a test charge from infinity to each of the plates is the same. Hence, the difference is zero.) On the other hand, charges of equal sign should repel each other; so there has to be a repulsive force in spite of a zero voltage difference.</p>

I know that we have the relation $2a \sin(\phi)=n \lambda $ where $\phi$ is the angle at which the neutrons are scattered and $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength. One way to estimate it (that came to mind) is via the uncertainty principle. We know that $\lambda= h/p$.  Hence the Bragg condition becomes $2a \sin(\phi)=(n h)/p$ which becomes $p= \frac{nh}{2a \sin(\phi)}$. Differentiating w.r.t $\phi$: $dp=-(nh/2d) \cdot \frac{\cos(\phi)}{ \sin(\phi)^{2}}d \phi$.</p>

"272759","Is there a basis for naming these empirical fluid model coefficients in terms of flow regime?","<p>Given any flow restrictive device (e.g. pipe, orifice, screen, etc.) one can measure data as the pressure drop across the device relative to the flow rate through the device. And from this data one can generally closely fit the polynomial</p>

<p>$$\Delta P = K_2Q^2+K_1Q $$</p>

<p>where $\Delta P$ is the pressure drop and $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate</p>

<p>Furthermore there have been people that (I believe) mis-appropriately attribute these factors to concepts involving Reynolds number, calling, for example $K_2$ the 'turbulent' flow factor and $K_1$ the 'laminar' flow factor. </p>

<p>While it is true that $K_1$ dominates the pressure drop at low flow, and $K_2$ dominates at high flow, I don't believe there is any basis  to attribute these empirical factors to laminar and turbulent flow characteristics.</p>

"272775","Problems while Wick rotating the path integral","<p>I am trying to begin from the path integral of QM and write the Euclidean version of it performing the Wick rotation but it seems that I am missing a few things.</p>

<p>For simplicity I work on 1 dimension and in natural units. The amplitude for a spinless particle of unit mass to go from the point $x_i$ to the point $x_f$ in a time interval $T$  is given by
$$
\int D[x]\,e^{i\int_0^Tdt\,\mathcal{L}(t)}
$$
$$
=\int D[x]\,e^{i\int_0^Tdt\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}}
$$
let's focus on the integral on the exponent
$$
\int_0^Tdt\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}
$$
to get the Euclidean path integral I have to Wick-rotate this. In order to do this I write the Lagrangian for a general complex variable $z=t+i\beta$
$$
\mathcal{L}(z)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{dz}\right)^2-V(x(z))
$$
and I consider the contour
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mttj5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mttj5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
I also assume (maybe naively) that there is no pole in bothering us for $\mathcal{L}(z)$. Cauchy's theorem allows us to write
$$
\int_{L_R}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)+\int_{L_I}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)+\int_{C}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)=0
$$
Let's go one by one. For $L_R$ I parametrize $z(t)=t$
$$
\int_{L_R}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)=\int_0^Tdt\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}
$$
For $L_I$ I have $z(\beta)=i\beta$
$$
\int_{L_I}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)=-i\int_0^Td\beta\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{id\beta}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}
$$
for $C$ i have $z(\phi)=Te^{i\phi}$
$$
\int_{C}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)=iT\int_0^{\pi/2}d\phi\,e^{i\phi}\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{iTe^{i\phi}d\phi}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}
$$
by Cauchy's theorem then
$$
\int_0^Tdt\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}=i\int_0^Td\beta\,\big\{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{d\beta}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}-\int_{C}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)
$$
if I plug this in the path integral I get
$$
\int D[x]\,e^{i\int_0^Tdt\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2-V(x)\big\}}
$$
$$
=\int D[x]\,e^{\int_0^Td\beta\,\big\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dx}{d\beta}\right)^2+V(x)\big\}}e^{-i\int_{C}dz\,\mathcal{L}(z)}
$$
and you see the problem here. I lack a minus sign in the first exponential, and the second one shouldn't be there. Maybe I can get the correct expression by manipulating the second exponential but I right now I don't see how. Anybody sees my mistakes?</p>

"272776","Norm of Classical (Poissonian) Hamiltonian Operator","<p>In the Poissonian formulation of classical mechanics, one finds that the time evolution of the phase space vector $\eta = (q_1,q_2\cdots q_n ; p_1, p_2\cdots p_n)^T$ can be put in terms of the exponential of the Hamiltonian operator.</p>

<p>$$\eta (\Delta t) = e^{\Delta t\hat{H}}\eta_0 \tag{1}$$
where $$\hat{H}(f)=\{f,H\} \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>and $H$ is the standard Hamiltonian of the particular dynamical system. When simply describing a particle in an external potential, the Hamiltonian takes the form</p>

<p>$$H=T+V=\frac{\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}+V(\mathbf{q}) \tag{3}$$</p>

<p>In this case, one can use eqn. (2) and carry out the Poisson brackets to find that</p>

<p>Hopefully this question is self contained, but please read the link above for full details, thanks.</p>

<p>The problem is set in momentum space, and deals with the multiplicity of a monotonic ideal gas. From my textbook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of independent wavefunctions is finite, if the total available position space and momentum space are limited. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5DU6Q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5DU6Q.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>L/$\Delta x$ is the number of distinct position states and L$_p$/$\Delta p$
is the number of distinct momentum states, (in a  1 dimensional system). The total number of distinct states is the product:</p>

<p>$\frac {L} {\Delta (x)}$$\frac {L_p} {\Delta (p )}$ =$\frac {LL_p} {h}$</p>

<p>Using the uncertainty principle.</p>

<p>My question is, what does this physically represent?</p>

<p>I am fairly familiar with Q.M., it is the momentum space concepts in thermodynamics that I am just starting to study.</p>

<p>My interpretation is that it simply represents the fact the particle could be at any distinct position within the space, and can have a distinct momentum at that position. So $X = 5$, $P = 7$, or any other combination of these distinct variables.</p>

<p>I self study, (with no one else to check with, so please excuse the confirm my idea aspect). If it's as simple as that explanation, I shall be excruciatingly embarrassed, but at least happy that I have it sorted out.</p>

"272786","Why is this non-linear transformation not a Lorentz transformations? It does preserve $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2t^2 = x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 - c^2t'^2 $","<p>The Lorentz transformation is a mapping of the $x', y',
z',$ and $t'$ coordinates relative to $x, y, z, t$ that preserves the speed of
light:</p>

<p>(1) $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2t^2 = x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 - c^2t'^2 = 0$</p>

<p>If $K'$ is moving with speed $v$ in the $x$ direction relative to $K$ (so that $K$ is moving with speed $-v$ in the $x$ direction relative to $K'$), and we use the Galilean transformation, we get an erroneous</p>

<p>(2) $x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 - c^2t'^2 = -2vxt + v^2t^2$</p>

<p>which is NOT equal to zero, and hence does not describe a sphere of
radius $ct$ emanating from the origin of $K'$, but something else (I'm
pretty sure it's a sphere that's been shifted negatively in the $x$
direction by a small amount, relative to $K'$). The Lorentz
transformation says we modify both the $x' = x - vt$ and the $t' = t$
relationships in order to ensure that we end up getting 0.</p>

<p>However, as a naive mathematician, I look at equation (2) and think,
""Ok, so we've got to modify the rule for $x'$, or $t'$, or both, to get
rid of that nasty $-2xvt + v^2t^2$ term in the $x'$ rule. Why not just
set $t'$ up so that instead of coming out to $-c^2t^2$, it actually comes
out to $-c^2t^2 + 2vxt - v^2t^2$, so that the extra terms cancel out?"" I
naively went ahead with this idea and I got the following coordinate
transformation:</p>

<p>$$
x' = x - vt\\
y' = y\\
z' = z\\
t' = \frac{1}{c} \sqrt{(v^2 + c^2)t^2 - 2vxt}
$$</p>

<p>If you plug this into (1), you get 0 like you're supposed to.</p>

<p>Now, I haven't been able to find an explanation as to why this transformation is unsatisfactory. Of course, it's no longer linear - but is there some basic reason why the transformation must be linear? Obviously this transformation satisfies Einstein's postulate about the constancy of the speed of light for all inertial observers.</p>

<p>Presumably, then, it must violate the first postulate, regarding the equivalence of all physical phenomena for inertial observers - otherwise we'd need more information in order to derive the Lorentz transformation, which I think is supposed to be derivable from the two postulates alone.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I have one question I'm trying to answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does this transformation violate equivalence for inertial observers? Why? (ideally, someone could give me an example of a force that suddenly appears in my coordinate system that didn't already exist in the other coordinate system)</li>

"272787","Fictitious Force Components in Rotating Coordinates","<p>I know this question falls more into the area of physics than mathematics, but it's an example meant to illustrate the effects of rotating basis vectors. </p>

"272791","Pulley system. Why do I need to put a minus sign?","<p>I am a mathematics undergraduate who's struggling to understand elementary physics. The following exercise looks particularly obscure to me.</p>

<p>A $3.70\,\text{kg}$ mass (let's call it $m_1$) is connected to a $2.30\,\text{kg}$ mass (let it be $m_2$) through a massless and inextensible rope, which is bent by a pulley like in the figure below.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/v4cMx.png""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/v4cMx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I need to compute the acceleration of the masses ($a$) and the tension of the rope ($T$). By considering two different reference frames for each mass (as the picture shows), I worked out the following equations for the forces acting on $m_1$ along its $x$-axis, and those acting on $m_2$ along its $y$-axis:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{cases}
T - m_1g\sin{30^{\circ}} = m_1a \\
T - m_2g = m_2a
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>In order to come up with this system, I observed that:</p>

<ul>
<li>$T$ must be the same at each end of the rope, because it is inextensible;</li>
<li>the same argument proves that the acceleration $a$ is the same for both masses;</li>
<li>$T$ has a positive direction in both reference frames, whereas $-m_1g\sin{30^{\circ}}$ and $-m_2g$ always have a negative one (hence the minus signs).</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I had done everything correctly, but when I attempted to compute $a$ and $T$ my results could not agree with those I found in my book. After a few tries, I found out that the above system would yield the right solutions, if only I change the sign of $m_2a$ like this:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{cases}
T - m_1g\sin{30^{\circ}} = m_1a \\
T - m_2g = \color{red}{-m_2a}
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>This apparently agrees with the fact that, from a physical point of view, $m_2$ will go downward while pulling $m_1$ toward the pulley. My question is: <strong><em>am I supposed to know this in advance?</em></strong> Do I need the knowledge of what-mass-is-pulling-the-other-one-and-where to solve the problem? I also have to mention that, because $m_1$ has a greater mass, I initially thought that $m_1$ would be the one sliding downward while lifting $m_2$ toward the pulley, so I tried to rewrite the first system with $-m_1a$ instead of $m_1a$ (leaving $m_2a$ untouched). As you can guess, that didn't help.</p>

<p>I just want to understand why my reasoning is flawed. I chose the signs of $T$, $-m_1g\sin{30^{\circ}}$, $-m_2g$ so that they would agree with the reference frames I used, while I had to leave $m_1a$ and $m_2a$ as they are because I did not know how the system would be going to evolve. Yet it seems this knowledge is necessary to understand the mechanics of the two masses. How is this possible?</p>

<p>I believe these are all related in the following way, but am unsure: </p>

<p><em>Projected BCS wavefunctions</em> are of the form
$$ \left| pBCS\right\rangle = P_G P_N \left| BCS\right\rangle = P_G P_N \prod_k (u_k + v_k c^\dagger_{k\uparrow} c^\dagger_{-k\downarrow})\left|0\right\rangle$$
where $P_N$ is a particle number projection operator and $P_G$ is the Gutzwiller projection operator, which projects out the double-occupancy of electrons in the same orbital. This is an example of a <em>fermionic RVB state</em>. </p>

<p>Assume that the electrons are on a lattice, such as in the Hubbard model. When $N$ is the number of lattice sites and $P_G$ forbids double-occupancy, then each site only has a single electron with spin up or down. These electrons are parts of spin singlets that extend between two sites, making this specific $\left| pBCS\right\rangle$ state a <em>spin liquid</em>. But, in general, spin liquids are not exclusively projected BCS wavefunctions.</p>

<p>What I am least clear on are bosonic RVB states and uniform RVB states (which I have heard can be written down as both fermionic and bosonic RVB states).</p>

If LISA’s interference pattern changed due to the Earth, Sun, or Moon being moved closer, it would violate this principle. Unfortunately, as the elevator is made smaller to avoid tidal effects, LISA becomes smaller and less sensitive.</p>

<p>Maybe the size of the elevator has nothing to do with the answer, hence the question.  It is expected LISA will be able to detect gravitational waves which strain the x and y positions of the mirrors.

"272812","Can mass-radius curves self-intersect?","<p>A common way to study models of stars is to choose an equation of state $\varepsilon (p)$, and then plot a mass-radius curve.  A point on the mass-radius curve is found by choosing a central pressure, that is, the pressure at the center of the star, and then solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation 
$$ \frac{\mathop{dP}}{\mathop{dr}} = -\frac{G}{r^2}\left( \varepsilon(r) + P(r)\right)  \left(m(r) + 4\pi r^3 P(r) \right) \left(1 - \frac{2 G m(r)}{r}\right)^{-1}  $$ with
$$ \frac{\mathop{dm}}{\mathop{dr}} = 4\pi r^2 \varepsilon(r) $$ with your given equation of state.  The solution of these pair of equations gives you a mass and a radius (the radius $R$ is defined such that $P(R) = 0$).</p>

<p>My question is, can the mass-radius curve self intersect?  That is, can there be two stars made of material with the same equation of state with the same mass and same radius, but with different central pressures, and thus different distributions of mass?</p>

"272820","Limitations of the ideal gas law: When does it fail?","<h1><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>

<p>I ask this question precisely because I am looking for a fundamental, quantitative explanation of the limitations of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law"" rel=""nofollow"">ideal gas law</a> and when it should not be used.</p>

<p>Note, I have found the following answers <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/91727/59023"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/91727/59023</a>, <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/43701/59023"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/43701/59023</a>, and <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17364/59023"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17364/59023</a> but in each case there was not a definitive or quantitative limitation prescribed.  The answers mention the limitations but it is not clear whether those limitations invalidate the use of $P = n \ k_{B} \ T$ [i.e., $n$ is the number density, $k_{B}$ the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">Boltzmann constant</a>, and $T$ a scalar temperature (well, one could make it a pseudotensor if they prefer)].</p>

<p>My primary motivation in asking this question derives from a conversation I had with a colleague about the differences between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow"">equilibrium</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">nonequilibrium</a> gases.</p>

<h1><strong>Example</strong></h1>

<p>For a specific example, consider the nearly collisionless (well, weakly collisional at best) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">plasma</a> in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"" rel=""nofollow"">solar wind</a>.  Here all the interactions are due to long-range forces (i.e., <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/268594/59023"">Coulomb collisions</a> and/or interactions with fluctuating electromagnetic fields), which as several of the answers above eluded, is a condition that the ideal gas law assumes to be negligible.  Further, the nearly collisionless, nonequilibrium state of this ionized <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases"" rel=""nofollow"">kinetic gas</a> coupled with the ubiquitous observations of non-<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">Maxwellian</a>, anisotropic velocity distributions (e.g., see <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/216819/59023"">What is the correct relativistic distribution function?</a> and references therein) causes me to doubt the applicability of <em>ideal gas</em> to these plasmas.</p>

<p>However, I know of several examples in physics where the assumptions used to derive relationships/approximations like the ideal gas law are not rendered invalid simply because one or more of the assumptions do not hold.</p>

<h1><strong>Clarifications</strong></h1>

<p>To be clear, I am not concerned with:</p>

<ul>
<li>the kinetic definition of pressure; or</li>
<li>the kinetic definition of number density; or</li>
<li>about how one defines a <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/218643/59023"">kinetic temperature</a> since we can define what is meant by $T$ as @AccidentalFourierTransform eludes to in comments to the question at <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/215722/59023"">Derivation of ideal gas law</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Questions</strong></h1>

<ul>
<li>I am curious how poor is the approximation $P = n \ k_{B} \ T$ for the solar wind plasma?

<ul>
<li>Note: I am not concerned about the multiple species or components so much as the underlying reasons justifying when we can assume $P = n \ k_{B} \ T$.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Should we consider a different <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state"" rel=""nofollow"">equation of state</a> for the system to derive a new/different relationship between pressure, density, and temperature?</li>
<li>Which is more critical to the relevance of the validity of $P = n \ k_{B} \ T$:  the nonequilibrium or nearly collisionless state of the plasma?</li>

"272850","Equipartition theorem: Missing energy?","<p>I seem to be unsure about a discrepancy in energy conservation utilizing the equipartition theorem. Let's say I have a molecule within a thermal reservoir. For example, I will use a molecule of $NH_3$. I will assume that the temperature of reservoir is sufficiently high enough that the high temperature limit can be assumed for the thermodynamical ensembles and molecule's internal energy will be share equally among its degrees of freedom. Specifically, I will focus on its translational, vibrational, and rotational motions.</p>

<p>According to the equipartition theorem, $NH_3$ should have three translational degrees of freedom (each of which gives $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} k_B T$</p>

<p>$$U_{tr}=\frac{3}{2} k_B T$$</p>

<p>Similarly for rotational energy</p>

<p>$$U_{rot}=\frac{3}{2} k_B T$$</p>

<p>And for a polyatomic molecule such as $NH_3$, there are $3N-6$ vibrational degrees of freedom each of which give energy $k_B T$ which gives</p>

<p>$$U_{vib}=6 k_B T$$</p>

<p>Therefore the total energy of the $NH_3$ molecule is</p>

<p>$$U_{tot}=9 k_B T$$</p>

<p>Now what if the $NH_3$ molecule completely dissociates so that</p>

<p>$$NH_3 \rightarrow N + 3H$$</p>

<p>Now we only have 3 translational degrees of freedom for each of the 4 atoms. This gives a total internal energy of the system to be</p>

<p>$$U_{tot}=6 k_B T$$</p>

<p>Of course due to energy conservation this energy must have gone somewhere. My question therefore is, where did the extra $3 k_B T$ worth of energy go? My best guess would be that it either was lost as heat to the surroundings when the bonds were broken or it went into the actual dissociation of the molecule. Would I be correct in any of these assumptions?</p>

"272853","Why T-duality only work when the background has isometries?","<p>I have been studying from some textbooks and papers about the T-dality topic.

<blockquote>
  <p>we can now give a more
  systematic discussion of T-duality, which is valid whenever the background has isometries.</p>

<p>and in [2]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One requires the metric to admit at least one continuous abelian isometry leaving invariant the $\sigma$-model action constructed out of $(g, b, \phi)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this manifold admits the
  action of an holomorphic isometry, the model is dual...</p>

Are isometries necesary for T-duality? or Is T-duality necesary for isometries(in the sense that if we have an isometry it is guaranteed to have a T-duality)?</p>

"272854","How to prove this theorem about adiabatic switching in scattering theory?","<p>I read a proposition in some paper but without no proof. It says as following:</p>

<p>Given a Hamitonian $H_0$ which has some discrete spectrum $|\psi_n\rangle$, $H_0|\psi_n\rangle=E_n|\psi_n\rangle$ and a rangle of continuous spectrum $|\psi_\lambda\rangle$ with energy $E_\lambda$. Compared with $H_0$, $H_i$ is an interaction and can be viewed as perturbation. Total Hamitonian is defined as $H=H_0+H_i$. If we introduce an adiabatic switching, $H(t)=H_0+ e^{-\epsilon|t|}H_i$ with $\epsilon\rightarrow +0$ and $H=H(0)$. If we begin with a eigenstate $|\psi\rangle$ of $H_0$ at $t=-\infty$ and $|\psi\rangle$ evolves by Hamitonian $H(t)$, then at $t=0$:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every $|\psi_n\rangle$ will become $|\Phi_n\rangle$ with $H|\Phi_n\rangle=E^\prime _n|\Phi_n\rangle$ and $E^\prime _n=E_n+\Delta E_n$.</p></li>
<li><p>Every $|\psi_\lambda\rangle$ will become $|\Phi_\lambda\rangle$ with $H|\Phi_\lambda\rangle=E_\lambda|\Phi_\lambda\rangle$. That is, for continuous spectrum there is no energy shift.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be some new bound states in $H$ which cannot corresponds to the eigenstates in $H_0$</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The above saying may not be stated rigorously, but I think it's right. Because 1 is what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_and_Low_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">Gell-Mann-Low theorem</a> says and 2 is what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lippmann_schwinger"" rel=""nofollow"">Lippmann-Schwinger theorem</a> says. However the problem is that when we prove Lippmann-Schwinger theorem, we've assumed the energy of continuous spectrum doesn't shift. And when we prove Gell-Mann-Low theorem, we've assumed there will be an energy shift for discrete spectrum. The above 3 propisitions are the prerequisites for Gell-Mann-Low theorem and Lippmann-Schwinger theorem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Riccardo Rattazzi, <em>The Path Integral approach to Quantum Mechanics, Lecture Notes for Quantum Mechanics IV,</em> 2009, page 21. I am having some issues to understand the small $\hbar$ expansion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the path integral in quantum mechanics giving the amplitude for a spinless particle to go from point $x_i$ to point $x_f$ in the time interval $T$
$$
\int D[x]e^{i\frac{S[x]}{\hbar}}=\ldots
$$
where
$$
S[x]=\int_{0}^{T}dt\,\mathcal{L}
$$
let's assume now that the action has one stationary point $x_0$. Let's change the variable of integration in the path integral from $x$ to fluctuations around the stationary point
$$
x=x_0+y
$$
$$
\ldots=\int D[y]e^{i\frac{S[x_0+y]}{\hbar}}=\ldots
$$
Let's Taylor expand the action around $x_0$
$$
S[x_0+y]=S[x_0]+\frac{1}{2}\int_0^T dt_1dt_2\,\frac{\delta^2S}{\delta x(t_1)\delta x(t_2)}\bigg|_{x_0}y(t_1)y(t_2)+\ldots
$$
which leaves us with
$$
\ldots=e^{i\frac{S[x_0]}{\hbar}}\int D[y]e^{\frac{i}{2\hbar}\int_0^T dt_1dt_2\,\frac{\delta^2S}{\delta x(t_1)\delta x(t_2)}\bigg|_{x_0}y(t_1)y(t_2)+\ldots}=\ldots \tag{1.65}
$$
this is where the author considers the rescaling
$$
y=\sqrt{\hbar}\tilde{y}
$$
which leaves us with
$$
\ldots=e^{i\frac{S[x_0]}{\hbar}}\int D[y]e^{\frac{i}{2}\int_0^T dt_1dt_2\,\frac{\delta^2S}{\delta x(t_1)\delta x(t_2)}\bigg|_{x_0}\tilde{y}(t_1)\tilde{y}(t_2)+\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{1/2})} \tag{1.66}
$$
and we ""obviously"" have an expansion in $\hbar$, so when $\hbar$ is small we may keep the first term
$$
e^{i\frac{S[x_0]}{\hbar}}\int D[y]e^{\frac{i}{2}\int_0^T dt_1dt_2\,\frac{\delta^2S}{\delta x(t_1)\delta x(t_2)}\bigg|_{x_0}\tilde{y}(t_1)\tilde{y}(t_2)}
$$
I do not like this rationale at all. It's all based on the rescaling of $y$ we have introduced, but had we done 
$$
y=\frac{1}{\hbar^{500}}\tilde{y}
$$
we wouldn't have obtained an expansion on powers of $\hbar$ on the exponent. What is the proper justification for keeping the quadratic term?</p>

"272870","Calculating current using Lorentz Force","<p>This problem comes from a chapter on Lorentz Force in my book on electromagnetism. Previous chapters were purely about electricity, this is the first one to include magnetism. So the assumption is I don't know any of Maxwell's equations yet (except ofcourse for Gauss's electric flux theorem). It consists of two parts, of which I have the answers but not the method. The second part has me completely stumped.</p>

<p>A thin metal ring turns around the axis through its center with a constant angular velocity $\omega$. The resistance in the ring is negligible. A static, homogeneous magnetic field $B$ is present through the ring parallel to the rotation axis.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> On the ring is a single spoke with length $l$ and resistance $R$. Calculate the electric potential induced on the spoke. (Answer: $\Delta V = \frac{\omega B l^2}{2})$</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Imagine the induced potential is tapped by placing two contacts, one in the center of the weel, and one at the top of the wheel. The resistance on the wire connecting these contacts equals $0.5R$. Calculate the current running through this wire. (Answer: $I = \frac{\omega B l^2 n}{(n+2)R}$)</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QKs0f.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QKs0f.png"" alt=""Ring in magnetic field""></a></p>

<p>First off, the Lorentz force on every part of the ring and the spoke would be pointing towards the center. Finding the potential is a matter of integrating the electric field along the spoke, which can be found using the Lorentz force equation: $E = \frac{F_{L}}{q} = v B sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \omega B l$. I understand the math for the first question, but what has actually happened inside the spoke? Did a negative charge gather at the center of the ring? Or is the Lorentz force just the thing that keeps the ring's rotational motion going?</p>

<p>The second question, and more specifically its answer, has me completely stumped. I'm not even sure if I know what the $n$ represents that suddenly pops up in the answer. The only $n$ I've run into before was used to define the amount of point charges in a system. I find I'm having a hard time intuitively describing what is going on too. The current flows out of the spoke, into the external resistance, and then what? Does it make a loop around the ring until it reaches the spoke again? Does it split both ways of the ring ending up back in the spoke? Is this current constant over time? Also, since the question specifically uses the phrase 'the potential is tapped', does this mean the potential in the spoke starts dropping once the current starts flowing?</p>

<p>To produce rotational motion by eletromagnetism, there are several ways and systems of doing it, but lets say I want to create rotational motion using a permanent magnet and a coil. The fixed magnet creates a constant magnetic field, and the coil, when current goes through it, creates a magnetic field, but this magnetic field has to change directions to create rotational motion, and it happens because current must change directions as well. </p>

<p>I know how it works, I've seen it, there are 2 brushes that current goes to and creates magnetic field. And there are 2 coils on the outside. So it doesn't matter if it is AC or DC, ok.</p>

<p>My question is because theoretically rotational motion is created if magnetic field changes direction, and I was wondering what would make it change direction.</p>

<p>If current must change directions, would it be used AC or DC to create rotational motion? Intuitively, It makes me think AC is always alternating directions and DC don't, so it would be AC.</p>

What I need is a rough estimate of how many liters I need to push through the chamber to get the majority of the fertilizer through.</p>

"272883","Standard Model: gravity and metrics","<p>I am struggling to understand the possible extension of the Standard Model with gravity (or for what it matters, bosonic string theory). Please forgive this silly question, as I am an engineer venturing into physics following Susskind's lectures. </p>

<p>Knowing there is <strong>no</strong> theory of gravity in SM, what are the possible reconciliations paths currently under research?</p>

<p>Let me explain my doubts.</p>

<p>As I understand GR explains how gravity is ""<em>not a force</em>"", but masses distort the space-time, and any particle will simply follow the most straight line under the metric due to the mass presence (for instance Schwarzschild or Kerr).</p>

<p>The SM, on the other hand, shows how forces are mediated through gauge bosons. </p>

<p>One extension of SM includes <em>gravitons</em> which are supposed to ""mediate"" gravity. As far as Susskind's lessons go, string theory is one possible way of including gravitons into being.</p>

<p>How can then be a non flat metric in the first place if gravity could be brought in a coherent extension of the SM?</p>

<p>I mean, particles ""gravitate"" around a mass because the metric is non flat, without any need for a gravity field. If we had a graviton, I don't understand how masses could distort space-time <strong>and</strong> make use of a gauge boson: in this case there should be a <em>field</em>, while GR does not imply a gravity field. I started from  many answers here, and of course Wikipedia, but this particular point is obscure, it seems to me that the theories are mutually exclusive, either a metric description or a field one as in SM.</p>

<p>Thanks for any pointers!</p>

The intake tube on my car has what I <em>believe</em> to be (I've been trying to research it) a type of Helmholtz resonator called a ""side branch"" resonator on it (please correct me if I'm wrong!).</p>

<p>My question here is about the following setup (I labelled random dimensions, I don't know what matters):</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oUqpD.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oUqpD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is a generalization of the intake on my car:</p>

<ul>
<li>Air flows through a cylinder of length L<sub>t</sub> and diameter D<sub>t</sub> (let's label its volume V<sub>t</sub>).</li>
<li>There is a ""side branch resonator"" P<sub>r</sub> from the tube entrance, with volume V<sub>r</sub>.</li>
<li>There is a pump that ""sucks"" air through in regular pulses, in the 25 - 250 Hz range (-ish, this is the car engine's intake valves opening and closing as the cylinders move down and decrease pressure, allowing air to be pushed in). Not labelled: The ""pump"" takes in a constant, fixed volume of air at every cycle, let's call it V<sub>d</sub>. If it's significant: This pump never provides a direct path from the intake side to the exhaust side.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is my understanding (might not be correct) that the resonator serves two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>To increase air flow by dampening harmonic reflections due to air flow being suddenly cut off (on the falling edge of each pump cycle), which cause the air mass to bounce back and create back pressure that interferes with the next pump cycle.</li>
<li>To dampen the sound produced by the intake (i.e. to dampen pressure changes that find their way out of the tube; not sure what path they usually take though, could be intake side, exhaust side, or through the tube walls, I don't know how it works).</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried reading about Helmholtz resonators but got confused because the articles about them <a href=""http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/nu_lectures/lecture3%20/ho_helmholtz/ho_helmholtz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">really focus on the neck of the resonator being smaller than its container</a>. I couldn't figure out how to extend it to these constant diameter side tubes, and I am having trouble visualizing how the air moves in this system.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How exactly does the resonator dampen reflections and allow for greater air flow? </li>
<li>How does it dampen audible sound outside this system?</li>
<li>How does the system behave differently if the resonator is not present?</li>
<li>How do the engineers calculate P<sub>r</sub> and V<sub>r</sub> given other parameters of the system?</li>
<li>Bonus question: Are there some values for the various parameters here that would make the resonator just a superfluous addition that has no effect? (The real-world reason for the bonus question is it's a topic of uncertainty on car forums whether or not removing the resonator helps or hurts vehicle performance, and I suspect the actual answer is dependent on specific parameters of a particular vehicle's intake design.)</li>

"272918","Does an object float more or less with more or less gravity?","<p>An object less dense than water (or any other fluid, but I'm going to use water for this example) floats normally on Earth when placed in water. But if the object was placed in a hypothetical place where there is no gravity and there is air, it would not float on water. So if the object was placed in water on a planet with more gravity than Earth, would it float more or would it float less, or float the same as on Earth?</p>

<p>Would it float more because it doesn't float without gravity, but it does float with Earth gravity, therefore it'd float even more with more gravity.</p>

<p>Or would it float less because more gravity would pull the object down, so it won't float as much.</p>

<p>Or would it'd float the exact same as on Earth because the above two scenarios cancel each other out.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> By ""float more,"" I mean it rises to the surface of the water faster, and it takes more force to push it down. By ""float less,"" I mean it rises to the surface of the water slower, and it takes less force to push it down.</p>

"272943","Motion of uniform accelerating rocket in special relativity","<p>I have been trying to learn more about acceleration in special relativity. For the purpose I consulted the great Lev Landau. He has an example about this in his book but one of his equations puzzles me. Consider a rocket accelerating in the positive $x$ direction.The four acceleration for an observer that sees the rocket moving at speed $v$ is given by</p>

<p>$$
a^{\mu}=\gamma \frac{d}{dt}(c\gamma,v\gamma) 
$$</p>

<p>In the instantaneous rest frame of the rocket where $v=0$, we have
$$
a^{\mu}=(0,a_0,0,0).
$$
This instantaneous frame I picture as the passengers of the rocket being pressed to their seats. </p>

<p>Then Landau claims that you could square the expressions for the two rest frames and obtain</p>

<p>$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = a
$$</p>

<p>The right hand side of this equation is clear, obviously it is the square of the four acceleration in the instantaneous rest frame. But how to get the right hand side from $a^{\mu}a_{\mu}$ in the system in which the rocket moves?
I would appreciate your help.</p>

<p>EDIT: 
Some Remarks
Written in an explicit form 
$$
a^{\mu}=\gamma^2\left(\frac{\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{ a}}{c}\gamma ,\frac{\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{a}}{c^2}\gamma v +\textbf{a } \right)
$$</p>

<p>Where 
$$
\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=\frac{\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{ a}}{c^2}\gamma^3
$$</p>

<p>Along these lines</p>

<p>$$
a_{\mu}a^{\mu}=\frac{\left(\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{ a}\right)^2}{c^2}\gamma^6 +\gamma^4a^2 = a_0^2
$$</p>

<p>with some vector algebra:
$$
a_{\mu}a^{\mu}=\frac{\left(\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{ a}\right)^2}{c^2}\gamma^6 +\gamma^4a^2 = \gamma^6\left(\frac{a^2v^2-(\textbf{a}\times \textbf{v})^2}{c^2} \right)+\gamma^4a^2=a_0^2
$$
If $\textbf{a} \parallel \textbf{v}$ the above reduces to 
$$
a_{\mu}a^{\mu}= \gamma^6\left(\frac{a^2v^2}{c^2} \right)+\gamma^4a^2=a_0^2,
$$
which is different from what Landau has. The following equation
$$
a_0=\gamma^3a,
$$</p>

<p>by using
$$
\frac{d}{dv}\left(\gamma v \right)=\gamma^3,
$$
reduces to
$$
\frac{d}{dv}\frac{dv}{dt}\left(\gamma v \right)=a_0
$$</p>

<p>But still one $a$ too much.</p>

<p>Remark:
What is an instantaneous rest frame?</p>

<p>Consider a rocket which undergoes constant acceleration along $\hat{x}$. Although the velocity is changing, we consider a frame in which the rocket
is <code>instantaneously</code> at rest. In such a frame, the rocket’s 4-acceleration is $(0, a_0 )$. Which is a key concept for this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Background/context</strong>:
I was thinking about how the fact that O(3) has two path components actually corresponds to real-life geometric observations about rotations, reflections, and orientation. Then I thought ""too bad it is a subset of 9-dimensional space and thus doesn't have any physical manifestation"". Which led to the thought -- maybe it does, since string theory predicts that we live in more than three dimensions.</p>

<p>(It turns out this line of thinking was dumb anyway though since apparently SO(3) and presumably also O(3) is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_group_SO(3)"" rel=""nofollow"">three-dimensional manifold</a>, so it actually wouldn't that be far-out to imagine that we lived in  the tangent space of it, but whatever.)</p>

<p>Anyway I remembered that SO(3) wouldn't be the appropriate model to consider, since physical theories postulate that we actually live in four-dimensional spacetime, rather than three-dimensional spacetime, so I should look for the dimension of the analogous matrix group for ""rotations"" or ""symmetries"" for spacetime. I thought it was the Lorentz group (which doesn't work because it only has six dimensions) but Wikipedia corrected me and it turns out it is the Poincare group, which apparently is ten-dimensional -- just like string theories postulate for the universe.</p>

<p>Experiments point toward memory chips 1,000 times faster than today's devices
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8  (Xinhua)-- A team of American researchers at Stanford University has experimented with an emerging memory technology that could store data permanently while allowing certain computer operations to occur up to 1,000 times faster than today's memory devices.</p>

<p>The 19-member team, led by Aaron Lindenberg, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University and of photon science at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, has worked on a new class of semiconductor materials and the result suggest that the new approach may be more energy efficient.</p>

<p>""This work is fundamental but promising,"" said Lindenberg. ""A thousandfold increase in speed coupled with lower energy use suggests a path toward future memory technologies that could far outperform anything previously demonstrated.""</p>

<p>While memory chips today are based on silicon technologies that switch electron flows on and off, representing the ones and zeroes that drive digital software, one possible next-generation technology is based on phase-change materials that can exist in two different atomic structures, each of which has a different electronic state. A crystalline, or ordered, atomic structure, permits the flow of electrons, while an amorphous, or disordered, structure inhibits electron flows.</p>

<p>By applying short bursts of heat, supplied electrically or optically, the structural and electronic states of these materials -- changing their phase from one to zero and back again. They retain whichever electronic state conforms to their structure. Once their atoms flip or flop to form a one or a zero, the material stores that data until another energy jolt causes it to change.</p>

<p>The new research, detailed in Physical Review Letters, focused on the unimaginably brief interval when an amorphous structure began to switch to crystalline, when a digital zero became a digital one. The intermediate phase -- where the charge flows through the amorphous structure like in a crystal -- is known as ""amorphous on.""</p>

<p>In the presence of a sophisticated detection system, the Stanford researchers jolted a small sample of amorphous material with an electrical field comparable in strength to a lightning strike. Their instrumentation detected that the amorphous-on state -- initiating the flip from zero to one -- occurred less than a picosecond after they applied the jolt.</p>

<p>Showing that phase-change materials can be transformed from zero to one by a picosecond excitation suggests that this emerging technology could store data many times faster than silicon computer RAM for tasks that require memory and processors to work together to perform computations.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers said the electrical field that triggered the phase change was of such a brief duration that it points toward a storage process that could become more efficient than today's silicon-based technologies. While much work remains to turn this discovery into functioning memory systems, attaining such speed using a low-energy switching technique suggests that phase-change technology has the potential to revolutionize data storage.</p>

<p>""A new technology which demonstrate a thousandfold advantage over incumbent technologies is compelling,"" Lindenberg said. ""I think we've shown that phase change deserves further attention."" </p>

<p>[EDIT August 9  5:19 A.M. Frank , My question is which of the two alternatives is better, Stanford Professor Aaron Lindenberg's 1 picosecond excitation or an array of 3 uncoupled Mach-Zenhder modulators each centered at either red , green or blue laser light wavelength or frequency whose outputs are fed into a 4 port optical circulator to prevent back reflection and control noise.</p>

"273021","Whether a ball thrown upwards will come back to the same position if we consider the effect of rotation of the earth","<p>My friend and I had a huge debate about whether the trajectory of a projectile thrown upwards will be affected by the rotation of the earth. We finally concluded after detailed explanations that it should be independent of whether earth is rotating or not. I can't ""explain"" the reason here (its basically related to the fact that the centripetal force due to gravity would act on it even if it is projected).  </p>

<p>This question can be simplified to:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether a ball thrown upwards will come back to the same position if we consider the effect of rotation of the earth?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We feel it should reach the same point but then the term Coriolis force struck our minds and we got confused...Can someone clear our confusion?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
My explanation:<br>
When the ball is on the ground, it rotates with the earth due to the centripetal force experienced due to gravity. Similarly, when the object is in air the only difference is that it has lost contact with the earth's surface. It already has a tangential velocity as it was projected from the ground and a centripetal acceleration towards the center of the earth. Therefore, it should still rotate around the axis of the earth as it was earlier (when it was on the ground).   </p>

<p>I now know that this doesn't happen from some posts on SE but am not clear with why this explanation is false.</p>

<p>I've thought of a game that my son and I can play in the swimming pool, he is 11 and weighs around 55kg's. I weight around 96kg's.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for the game involves creating a bag that can keep us buoyant. While a bag that can support my weight would also suit a small child, I would like to create a smaller bag for children.</p>

<p>The idea here is that the bag will be in front of us and we can put our arms over it and just float.</p>

<p>The bag should be as small as possible so that it doesn't get in the way too much, so I am thinking of the bag being roughly the size of an A4 sheet of paper.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a bag this size (A4) capable of holding up an adult of say 120kg's?</li>
<li>What should/could the bag be filled with to assist in the buoyancy, helium etc?</li>
<li>Is this even possible, and if not, what would the minimum size of the bag be to support a 120kg human?</li>
<li>How would the calculations change if I was to use it at sea with the buoyancy being provided by sea water?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried to calculate the buoyancy myself, but there are just too many unknowns for me, how do I calculate the volume, how do I know how much will be submerged, do I need to add the weight of the human to the calculation etc?</p>

<p>A step by step guide on how to calculate it would be massively appreciated if its not too difficult.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
I've come across this site <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Buoyancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Buoyancy</a> which gives detailed steps on how to calculate buoyancy.
Having performs these steps with my weight (less the weight of my head +- 5kg's because that will be outside the water), I get 905.978 newtons required. I've then calculated my total weight (including weight of head) and got a total buoyancy force of 941.76 newtons.
I.E. I'll sink, which is obvious and that's why we need to wade in water.
So my thinking now is that if I were to create a bag for the difference of +- 36 newtons, then I'd float.
Is that thinking correct?</p>

"273048","Difficulty with Kinetic Energy","<p>First I would like to apologize for the vague headline, I couldn't find a way to put it in one sentence.
I found something a bit strange when trying to calculate the kinetic energy of an object from rest to motion.
Lets say I'm a fat yet fast runner, I weigh 100 KG and I run at a speed of 10 m/s, now lets calculate my kinetic energy:</p>

<p>Ek=1/2mv^2</p>

<p>Ek=1/2*100*10^2=5,000J</p>

<p><strong>Ek=5KJ</strong></p>

<p>Now lets say I run in an airplane flying in the speed of 500 m/s, my initial kinetic energy is:</p>

<p>Ek=1/2*100*500^2=12,500,000J</p>

<p><strong>Ek=12.5MJ</strong></p>

<p>So far so good, the problem starts when I start running, again at 10 m/s:</p>

<p>Ek=1/2*100*(500+10)^2=13,005,000J</p>

<p><strong>Ek=13.005MJ</strong></p>

<p>Now lets check how much energy I needed to put in:</p>

<p>13.005MJ-12.5MJ=<strong>505KJ</strong></p>

<p>I used 505KJ to run in an airplane compared to a usual situation where I only used 5KJ. That's a <strong>0.5MJ difference!</strong></p>

<p>If I were to actually run in an airplane, would I really need to put that much more energy/force? This also makes me confused because when we stand at Earth, we're not actually stationary, since Earth constantly rotates and travels through space, wouldn't it mean I'll need more energy to move with the Earth's rotation compared to moving against it?</p>

<p>This sort of paradox baffled me for years. Can anyone help me to make sense out of it?</p>

"273052","Calculating orbital velocities of stars in disk galaxies","<p>In Barbara Ryden's <em>Intro to Cosmology</em>, chapter 8.2, she derives and equation for the radial velocities of stars around the center of their disk galaxy. </p>

<p>First, she states that when we look at disk galaxy, we see it with an inclination angle $\theta$, hence it appears elliptic with axis ratio $\frac{b}{a} = \cos\theta$.</p>

<p>Then, she states that by measuring the redshift of absorption or emission lines from the disk, we can find the radial velocity $v_r(R) = cz(R)$, where $R$ is the distance from the center of the galaxy. She states that this radial velocity is along the apparent long axis of the galaxy. Two questions about this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cosmological redshift is not generally a Doppler shift. Doppler shift occurs due to peculiar velocities. What kind of redshift does she mean here? If it is the Doppler shift, how can one distinguish between the redshift caused by the expansion of the universe and the redshift caused by the peculiar velocity?</li>
<li>This 'radial velocity along the apparent long axis of the galaxy' is not clear to me. Does she talk about the radial velocity <strong>towards</strong> the observer? Or maybe the radial velocity around the center of the galaxy? If the latter, how is the redshift related to it?</li>
</ol>

<p>She then states that 'Since the redshift contains only the component of the stars' orbital velocity that lies along the light of sight, thre radial velocity we measure will be 
$$
v_r(R) = v_{gal} + v(R)\sin{\theta}
$$
where $v_{gal}$ is the radial velocity of the galaxy as a whole, resulting from the expansion of the universe.' This last derivation was really unclear.</p>

"273054","Uncertainty Principle derivation confusion","<p>In the textbook titled Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering by Riley, Hobson and Bence, 3rd edition, there is a section on page 664 on the derivation of the uncertainty principle.</p>

<p>It starts of by considering two state vectors $ \left|u \right&gt;$ and $ \left|v\right&gt;$, and a real scalar $\lambda$. Letting $ \left|w\right&gt; = \left|u \right&gt; + \lambda \left|v \right&gt; $, we take the inner product of $ \left|w\right&gt; $ with itself and remember that the norm squared is always greater or equal to $0$.</p>

<p>$$ 0 \leq \left&lt;w|w\right&gt; = \left&lt;u|u\right&gt; + \lambda(\left&lt;u|v\right&gt; + \left&lt;v|u\right&gt;) + \lambda^2 \left&lt;v|v\right&gt; $$</p>

<p>It then says that this is a quadratic inequality in $\lambda$ and therefore the quadratic equation formed by equating the RHS to zero must have no real roots. What I don't understand is why mustn't it have real roots? We defined that $\lambda$ was real in the first place!</p>

"273058","Beginner question, for Bra-Ket algebra for exercise 1.1 in Quantum Mechanics The Theoretical Minimum","<p>I am reading the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0465062903"" rel=""nofollow"">Quantum Mechanics The Theoretical Minimum</a> and the first exercise is as follows with a <a href=""http://theuncertainbiscuit.uk/exercise1.1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">given solution from this webpage</a>. The problem I have is I don't understand how $\langle C| (|A\rangle + |B\rangle)=[ \langle A| + \langle B|] |C\rangle)^*$. I have bolded the line I do not understand below. How did the $(|A\rangle + |B\rangle)$ suddenly change into $(\langle A| + \langle B|)$ when the axiom $\langle B|A\rangle=\langle A|B\rangle^*$ is applied here?</p>

<p>I can accept the rest of the solution.</p>

<p><em>Exercise 1.1</em></p>

<p>a) using the axioms for inner products, prove $(\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle = \langle A|C\rangle + \langle B|C\rangle$</p>

<p><em>Answer</em></p>

<p>Section 1.9.4 has 2 axioms for inner products:</p>

<ol>
<li>$\langle C| (|A\rangle + |B\rangle)  = \langle C|A\rangle + \langle C|B\rangle$   </li>
<li>$\langle B|A\rangle=\langle A|B\rangle^*$</li>
</ol>

<p>Well the first axiom is pretty like we are trying to ‘prove’ we just want to get all the $C$’s to the other side.  The second axiom does this for simple bra-kets. </p>

<p>If we say  $\langle C|D\rangle=\langle D|C\rangle^*$   from axiom 2 and that $|D\rangle=|A&gt; + |B\rangle$
<strong>then replacing $D$ by the sum of $A$ and $B$:   $\langle C| (|A\rangle + |B\rangle)=[ (\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle]^*$</strong></p>

<p>If we multiply out the left hand side.  $\langle C|A\rangle +\langle C|B\rangle=[ (\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle]^*$
and then take the complex conjugate of each term $\langle C|A\rangle^* +\langle C|B\rangle^*=[ (\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle]^{* *}$ </p>

<p>Then axiom 2 says the two items on the left become  $\langle A|C\rangle +\langle B|C\rangle$  and can we assume the conjugating a conjugate gives the original? since conjugation is reversing the sign on the imaginary bit I think we can.</p>

<p>So $\langle A|C\rangle +\langle B|C\rangle=(\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle^{ **}=(\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle$ 
or $(\langle A| + \langle B|) |C\rangle=\langle A|C\rangle +\langle B|C\rangle$ as required.</p>

"273064","Does steady flow $\implies$ $\int_{V} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV=0$?","<p>I'm studying the derivation of the continuity equation for fluids. For steady flow (supposing sections perprendicular to velocity vectors, and assuming velocity is unifrom throughout the sections):</p>

<p>$$\rho_1 S_1 v_1=\rho_2 S_2 v_2\tag{1}$$
Where $\rho$ is density  (which <strong>can also not be constant</strong>), $S$ are the sections and $v$ are velocities.</p>

<p>The only assumptions for the equation (besides the one listed above) above is that the flow is <strong>steady</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The previous equation is derived from the more general <strong>mass conservation principle</strong> which states, for a volume $V$ and the corresponding surface $S$
$$\int_{S} \rho \vec{v} \cdot \hat{n} dS=-\int_{V} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>I understood the principle, which is completely general and do not require any condition for the fluid. Nevertheless it is not clear how is it possible to pass from $(2)$ to $(1)$ in the case of <strong>steady flow</strong>.</p>

<p>I quote the reasoning used for derivation of eq $(1)$ from $(2)$ done on <em>Cengel-Cimbala</em>, which is not clear to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During a steady-flow process, the total amount of mass contained within a control volume $V$ does not change with time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this means  $$\int_{V} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV=0$$</p>

<p>And from this, using $(2)$ the equation $(1)$ is derived (under condisions of $\vec{v}$ constant and $\vec{v} \, || \, \hat{n}$).</p>

<hr>

<p>The condition of steady flow means $$\frac{\partial \vec{v}(x,y,z,t)}{\partial t}=0$$</p>

<p>So how is this related to the fact that the ""mass in the volume $V$ cannot change""? I do not see how this implication must hold:
$$\frac{\partial \vec{v}(x,y,z,t)}{\partial t}=0 \implies \int_{V} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV=0$$</p>

<p>Maybe did I interpreted the quote in the wrong way? Or is this implication really true? If so, what is the reasoning behind it?</p>

"273066","What is the smallest energy of a system of 2 spin 1/2 electrons?","<p>This question comes directly from ""Conquering the Physics GRE"" by Kahn and Anderson.</p>

<p>Two spin-1/2 electrons are placed in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential of angular frequency $\omega$. If a measurement of $S_z$ of the system returns $\hbar$, which of the following is the smallest possible energy of the system?</p>

<p>(The answer is $2\hbar\omega$.)</p>

<p>There is a solution in the book but I can't follow it. Can someone hopefully take the time to walk me through this?</p>

<p>Edit: Book solution</p>

<p>Here is the book solution:</p>

<p>Total $S_z=\hbar$ means the electrons must be in the triplet state, which is symmetric. For a totally antisymmetric wavefunction, the spatial wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This knocks out the ground state, where both electrons are in the $n=0$ state of the harmonic oscillator, since after antisymmetrization this vanishes identically. So the next available state is an antisymmetrized version having $n=0$ and $n=1$:
$$\psi_{spatial}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_1 |1\rangle_2-|1\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2).$$
This is an energy eigenstate with energy $\hbar\omega/2+3\hbar\omega/2$.</p>

<p>My updated questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do the states need to be antisymmetrized?</li>
<li>How does the equation for $\psi_{spatial}$ give the energy of $\hbar\omega /2+3\hbar\omega /2$?</li>

"273067","Defining 'direction' in electrostatic vector equation","<p>How is the notion of 'direction' defined in the electrostatic vector equation?</p>

<p>$$\vec{E}\ = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o} \cdot\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$$</p>

<p>For example, let's say I want to evaluate the electric field at some point $A$, which is composed of two electric fields produced by two oppositely charged particles $q_1$ and $q_2$ at points $B$ and $C$.</p>

<p>$$\vec{E}_A\ = \vec{E}_B\ + \vec{E}_C$$
$$\implies \vec{E}_A\ = k \cdot\frac{q_1}{r_{ab}^2}\hat{r}_{b} + k \cdot\frac{q_2}{r_{ac}^2}\hat{r}_{c}$$</p>

<p>Now if $q_1$ is negative and $q_2$ is positive, does this just becomes:</p>

<p>$$\implies \vec{E}_A\ = -k \cdot\frac{q_1}{r_{ab}^2}\hat{r}_{b} + k \cdot\frac{q_2}{r_{ac}^2}\hat{r}_{c}$$</p>

<p>Are the unit vectors $\hat{r}_{b}$ and $\hat{r}_{c}$, modified in any way? Or do they just retain their usual meanings as unit vectors in the direction from $A$ to $B$ and from $A$ to $C$, and thus have nothing to do with whether the electric field is pointing in which ever direction?</p>

<p>So if I let $B = (b_x, b_y)$, $A = (a_x, a_y)$, $C = (c_x, c_y)$, would the equation become the following:</p>

<p>$$\implies \vec{E}_A\ = -k \cdot\frac{q_1}{(a_x - b_x)^2 +(a_y-b_y)^2}\begin{bmatrix} a_x-b_x \\ a_y-b_y \end{bmatrix}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{(a_x - b_x)^2 + (a_y - b_y)^2}} \\+ k \cdot\frac{q_1}{(a_x - c_x)^2 +(a_y-c_y)^2}\begin{bmatrix} a_x-c_x \\ a_y-c_y \end{bmatrix}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{(a_x - c_x)^2 + (a_y - c_y)^2}}$$</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason I ask this is that the geometric direction of the unit vectors, does not always correspond with the physical direction of the electric field. </p>

<p>For example take $q_1$ negative at $A$ and $q_2$ positive at $B$. A unit vector $\hat{r}_{ab}$ would correspond to a vector of magnitude 1 'pointing' either from $A$ to $B$ <strong>or</strong> from $B$ to $A$ depending on the sign of $\hat{r}_{ab}$. But the physical direction of the electric field is from $B$ to $A$</p>

<p>Does that mean that the sign in front of the unit vector is the sole determinant of the direction of the electric field in the vector equation?</p>

"273094","Deriving the magnetic field around a current from Coulomb's law and SR","<p>The magnetic force which a current-carrying wire exerts on a moving charge can be derived from Coulomb's Law and special relativity. It's easy to show that if a straight wire has current density $\lambda$ and a particle with charge $q$ is a distance $r$ away from the wire, then the particle experiences a force perpendicular to the wire of magnitude $$F = \frac{\lambda q}{2\pi\epsilon_0r}$$
Further, we expect 
$$F_B = \frac{\mu_0 Iqv}{2\pi r}$$
Where $v$ is the velocity of the particle. For simplicity's sake, assume the wire is neutrally charged in the given reference frame, and the wire has a density $\phi = \frac{I}{v}$ of negative moving charges (which are also moving at speed $v$ for simplicity). Letting $F=F_B$, we expect the apperent charge density of the wire in the particle's inertial frame to be $\lambda = \mu_0\epsilon_0 I v=\frac{Iv}{c^2}$. </p>

<p>Shifting to the particle's inertial frame, The density of negative charges decreases by a factor of $\gamma$, and the density of positive charges increases by a factor of $\gamma$. Therefore,
$$\lambda = \phi\gamma - \phi/\gamma = \phi(\gamma-1/\gamma) = \gamma\frac{Iv}{c^2}$$
Which is off from what we expect by a factor of $\gamma$. This can be fixed if we assume $v/c\approx0$, but does this mean that the law used to derive $F_B$ is only valid for slowly moving currents (which seems strange, since that formula follows from Ampere's law), or have I made a mistake in my reasoning? </p>

"273106","Links between laminar-turbulent and steady-unsteady flows","<p>I report some definitions of flow characteristics as given on <em>Cengel Cimbala</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Laminar or turbolent </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Laminar flow</strong>:  A stable well-ordered state of fluid flow in which all pairs of adjacent fluid particles move alongside one another forming laminates. A flow that is not laminar is either turbulent or transitional to turbulence, which occurs above a critical Reynolds number. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Turbulent flow</strong>: An unstable disordered state of vortical
  fluid flow that is inherently unsteady and that contains eddying
  motions over a wide range of sizes (or scales). Turbulent flows are
  always at Reynolds numbers above a critical value that is large
  relative to 1. Mixing is hugely enhanced, surface shear stresses are
  much higher, and head loss is greatly increased in turbulent flows as
  compared to corresponding laminar flows.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Steady or unsteady </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Steady flow</strong> : A flow in which all fluid variables (velocity, pressure, density, temperature, etc.) at all fixed points in the flow are constant in time (but generally vary from place to place). Thus, in steady flows all partial derivatives in time are zero. Flows that are not precisely steady but that change sufficiently slowly in time to neglect time derivative terms with relatively little error are called quasi-steady. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Unsteady flow</strong>: A flow in which at least one variable at a fixed point in the flow changes with time. Thus, in unsteady flows a partial
  derivative in time is nonzero for at least one point in the flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I have two main doubt about this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are these two couple of characteristics completely indipendent one from the other? In other words, can I have, for istance, besides a laminar steady flow and a turbulent unsteady flow, also a laminar unsteady flow or a turbolent steady flow? (Which sounds very strange)</li>
<li>Can an ideal fluid ($\rho=const$ and $\eta=0$), in steady flow (for which Bernoulli equation is valid) be in a turbolent flow? Or is it implicitly considered to be in laminar flow?</li>

<p>Therefore I have a doubt there, why do i need to use in this case an antilinear operator?

<p>Two cars approach each other at the same constant speed relative to earth. Special theory of relativity (SPR) tells us that the clocks inside each car will run slower than an identical clock at rest. Most importantly, the clocks inside each car run at the same (slower) rate because they are traveling at the same speed. SPR also tells us that whenever relative motion exists between two inertial frames of reference, the approaching clocks will run at different rates.  Yet in this case the approaching clocks run at the same rate (as demonstrated above). How can SPR explain this paradox?</p>

"273110","How to derive exterior and/or interior schwarzschild solution using Feynman excess radius equation?","<p>Feynman excess radius equation for a uniformly dense spherical body is
$R-\sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi } } = \frac{G}{3c^{2}} M$</p>

<p>Where $R$ is the radius directly measured by digging a hole in the body, $ A $ is the surface area of the body and $M$ is its mass.</p>

<p>I tried to use this equation, coupled with the fact that exterior gravitation due to a uniformly dense spherical body does not depend upon the radius of the body, to derive schwarzschild solution.</p>

<p>This is what I did:</p>

<p>$R-x = M$ (where $ x= \sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi } }$  ($x$ is the predicted radius); and $\frac{G}{3c^{2}}=1$.)</p>

<p>$\Rightarrow R-x=g\int 4\pi x^{2} dR,$ (where $g$ is the density of the body)</p>

<p>$\Rightarrow 1-\frac{dx}{dR} =4\pi gx^{2}$</p>

<p>$ \Rightarrow \frac{dR}{dx} =\frac{1}{1-4\pi gx^{2}} $</p>

<p>My idea was to calculate, for every value of $x$, the value of  $\frac{dR}{dx}$, for different values of density $g$, such that for every value of $x=a$, $ g.\int ^{a}_{0}4\pi x^{2}dR=M=constant $. So i would get  $\frac{dR}{dx}$ in the form of $x$ for every value of $x=a$, and integrate it to get the solution.</p>

<p>But many disasters happened in this scheme. Let me summarize by saying that, according to my understanding of Feynman excess radius equation, one needs infinite mass to create an event horizon around a uniformly dense spherical body. In other words,  $\frac{dx}{dR}=0$ if and only if $R=\infty$. Which does not makes sense.  </p>

<p>So, the question is, how will you derive the exterior and/or interior schwarzschild solution using excess radius equation?</p>

"273111","How can the speed of light be independent of the speed of the observer","<p>First of all, I saw few similar questions here but most of them address the question of why, when I want to address a question of <em>HOW</em>. Also one question is addressing the same problem but I find it's formulation rather complicated and this makes it difficult to understand the question and answers. When the problem can be described and visualized in much simple way:</p>

<p>Let's consider a spaceship floating under the Earth. There is a source of light and at time <code>0s</code> the light will reach some point on Earth and the end of spaceship:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fz1ev.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fz1ev.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
Then, after 1 second have passed on Earth, we will see the following picture:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/A0voe.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/A0voe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As we can see, relatively to the Earth the light have made a distance of 300,000 km in 1 second. But relatively to the spaceship the distance is half of that. When explaining how this can happen, usually <strong>they say that clock on the rocket will tick slower</strong> so speed calculated by folks on the spaceship is the same. </p>

<p>And it sounds believable until you imagine an other source of the light from an other end of the scene:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fPxeV.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fPxeV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
In this case by the same time the light from an other source have made a distance of 450,000 km. So if we use the same time as we did in previous case, the speed must be different.</p>

<p>So how can you imagine\describe the same speed for light from both sources and for both reference frames?</p>

The problem is also asking me to find $$ \psi(x,0) = \sum_{n}^{\infty} c_n \psi_n(x) $$ and to determine the expansion coefficients $c_n$. I did that by using the orthonormality conditions. For the infinite potential well we know that the wave functions are given as $$\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L}). $$ So I used $$ c_m = \int \psi_m^*(x) \psi(x,0) dx $$ and found the expansion coefficients as $$ c_n = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{when n is odd} \\ - \frac{\sqrt{24}}{n \pi} &amp; \text{when n is even} \end{cases}$$ I also need to find the wave function $\Psi(x,t)$ at any later time. I wrote $$ \Psi(x,t) = \sum_n c_n \psi_n(x) \exp(-iE_nt / \hbar) $$ where $$E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} $$ for the potential well. But the final question of this problem asks me to find the expectation value of the energy. So this means I have to find $$ \langle H \rangle = \int \Psi^*(x,t) H \Psi(x,t) dx  = \int \big( \sum_m c_m \psi_m \exp(iE_mt / \hbar \big) H \big( \sum_n c_n \psi_n \exp(-iE_nt / \hbar) \big) dx $$ ?

Griffiths textbook says (chapter two) that if $$ \Psi(x,t) = \sum_n c_n \psi_n(x) \exp(-iE_nt / \hbar) $$ then $$ \langle H \rangle = \sum_n^{\infty} E_n |c_n|^2. $$ But how do I know this series will converge? </p>

I've tried to check for this already being answered, but couldn't find quite the same problem. Sorry if I missed it...</p>

<p>If two observers move in opposite directions at the same speed (say 0.5c) from a resting observer, how will the clock of the symmetrical system seem to tick for the opposite observer ?</p>

<p>All observers start at t0=0, x=0. I apply c=1
At times resp t1=0,5 and t2=1, the positions of the two moving obs are + and - 0,25 and 0,5 in the resting frame of ref.
When I compute their position and time in their own frames, I logically obtain:
x'=0 at all times (observers at rest in own ref), t'1=0,433 ; t'2=0,86. Their clocks run slower than the clock in rest frame. All fine (i think).</p>

<p>So now I proceed to compute the relative speed of one of the moving observers with respect to the other one. I get 0,8c, which seems to be correct.</p>

<p>Subsequently, I apply Lorentz transform once more to compute the x''s and t''s of the observer moving at 0,8c in the frame of ref of its companion, using [x'1,t'1], and [x'2,t'2]. I obtain 
x''1 = 0,577; t''1 = 0,72
x''2 = 1,154; t''2 = 1,44</p>

<p>Being new to relativity, I would have expected the clock of the observer moving away at 0.8c to be slower, but it doesn't seem to work that way...</p>

<p>Moreover, I checked the Minkowsky invariants, and they are invariant, so I surmise that my calculations could be right, but that my brains don't interpret the result correctly. </p>

<p>Where is my mistake? In the way I apply the Lorentz transform, or in my interpretation of the result?  </p>

As north and south pole attract, the force due to external magnetic $F_{B_{ext}}$ field should be towards the magnet behind the atom. However the net force is perpendicular to that expected and if we take many atoms, the net force should be zero.

"273176","Could we ""see"" into the future using time dilation?","<p>Let O1 be an observer in frame S1 where F(g) is very high. And O2 be an observer in S2 where F(g) is lower. Due to time dilation the time for O2 would appear to pass slowly from S2 and vice versa. Therefore could an event in S2, E1 be observed (and information about it transmitted) by O1 (for whom time in S2 is running faster) to O2 thereby giving information about an event that hasn't occurred in O1's frame of reference. This is assuming that the spacetime separation for E1 from O2 is mainly composed of the (ct)^2 (it happens a significant distance in time). Is there some logical error in my thinking?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: 
Here is my proposed logic for the answer by flippiefanus:</p>

<p>Let $O_1$ be an observer in frame $S_1$. Also Let $O_2$ be an observer in frame $S_2$.<br/>
Now let an event $E$ occur in frame $S_2$.</p>

<p>The following calculations are based in frame $S_1$ with reference frame of $O_1$:</p>

<p>Using the gravitational time dilation equations:
$$
\Delta t_o (O_1E_1) = \Delta t_{O_1E_1} \sqrt{1-\frac{r_{S_1}}{r}}
$$
 And,
$$
\Delta t_o (O_1O_2) = \Delta t_{O_1O_2} \sqrt{1-\frac{r_{S_1}}{r}}
$$</p>

<p>Also,
$$
\Delta t_o (O_2E) = \Delta t_{O_2E} \sqrt{1-\frac{r_{S_1}}{r}}
$$
 (The above equation is a rather important one. The reason this equation uses $r_{S_1}$ instead of $r_{S_2}$ to calculate all the distances from the same frame of reference)</p>

<p>In the above equations $t_o$ is the proper time which is invariant across frames and $t_{O_xO_y}$ is the time between the events as measured in a frame with a low gravitational field (frame $S_2$). however, the exact frame does not matter as long as all the calculations are made in the same frame.</p>

<p>Now, 
$$
t_o (O_1E+O_1O_2)-\Delta t_o (O_2E) = \sqrt{1-\frac{r_{S_1}}{r}}(\Delta t_{O_1E}+\Delta t_{O_1O_2}-\Delta t_{O_2E})
$$
$$
= \sqrt{1-\frac{r_{S_1}}{r}}(cT_1+cT_2-cT_3)
$$
where $T_1,T_2,T_3$ are the times measured in frame $S_2$ (or any other frame). They are multiplied by $c$ to keep up with convention and convert units of distance, this does not affect the value of time since $c$ is invariant.</p>

<p>Therefore, </p>

<p>We get a 3 irreducible cases (in 2d space):</p>

<p>1st case:- <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sX2Bj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sX2Bj.jpg"" alt=""1st case""></a>
Here $(cT_1+cT_2-cT_3)$ is exactly 0 $\Rightarrow$ both signals reach at same time (assuming no time is used in re transmission)</p>

<p>2nd case:- where E happens to the right of $O_2$ with $O_1$ to the right of $E$.</p>

<p>Here $(cT_1+cT_2-cT_3)$ is positive implying $\Delta t_o (O_1E+O_1O_2)&gt;\Delta t_o (O_2E) \Rightarrow$ signal from $E\rightarrow O_1 \rightarrow O_2$ reaches $O_2$ after $E\rightarrow O_2$</p>

<p>3rd case:- where E happens to the left of $O_2$ with $O_1$ to the right of $O_2$.</p>

<p>Here too $(cT_1+cT_2-cT_3)$ is positive implying $\Delta t_o (O_1E+O_1O_2)&gt;\Delta t_o (O_2E) \Rightarrow$ signal from $E\rightarrow O_1 \rightarrow O_2$ reaches $O_2$ after $E\rightarrow O_2$</p>

<p>Since proper time is invariant we don't need to confirm calculations with distance in spacetime, however this would be pretty simple since the distances from $S_2$ would also be invariant in the same frame.</p>

<p>Therefore we get a light cone where the signal $E\rightarrow O_1 \rightarrow O_2$ when received at $O_2$ is a time like event whereas the signal $E \rightarrow O_2$ when received at $O_2$ is a light like event </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WYOgr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WYOgr.jpg"" alt=""Light cone""></a></p>

<p>$\Rightarrow$ $E\rightarrow O_1 \rightarrow O_2$ can never reach $O_2$ faster than $E \rightarrow O_2$.</p>

<p>It seems the doubts I was having were similar to those of the twin effect, that is- I was looking at the different parts of the signal journey from different reference frames. Once I got that sorted out things became clearer. I hope this can help someone else if they get confused in a similar situation, this at least reinforced the importance of reference frames for me. </p>

$$\vec{E} = - \nabla \phi = - \nabla (\phi_1 + \phi_2) = - \nabla \phi_1 - \nabla \phi_2 = \vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2}$$ what the superposition principle is claiming. The superposition principle is sometimes called a postulate in electrostatics. But couldn't it be ""derived"" in that way? </p>

"273187","In a RLC Circuit, what is the effect of Resonance?","<p>The book I am reading does not go into greater detail of what Resonance within a circuit really is. The only definition I am given is that of the Resonant Angular Frequency. Which is the angular frequency for maximum oscillation.</p>

<p>$$\omega L= \frac{1}{\omega C}
$$
$$ \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$</p>

<p>Where L is Inductance and C is capacitance. I can see here that the resonance depends on the values for capacitance and inductor's.</p>

<p>From the definition alone, I'd guess that it'd mean the frequency at which you're getting a maximum current when ever the maximum electro-motive force is held constant.</p>

<p>$$I = \frac{E}{Z}  $$Where Z is the impedance of the RLC circuit. And E is EMF max.</p>

<p>So... the current is at it's max when the Inductance and Capacitance are both zero. I'd guess that this would mean that a circuit would be seen as if only the Resistors are in effect.</p>

"273223","Relevance of the condensate $\langle 0 | \bar q q | 0 \rangle$ to SSB of chiral QCD symmetry","<p>The QCD lagrangian with two massless flavours of quarks takes the form $$\mathcal L = \sum_{i=u,d} i \bar q_i \gamma_{\mu} D^{\mu} q_i.$$ Defining operators to project out the left and right handed components of the quark fields and rewriting the lagrangian in terms of these components  we see that there is no coupling between them.  Because of the anomalous $U(1)_A$, the symmetry of massless QCD is then said to be $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R$.  </p>

<p>In Matthew Schwartz's book, P.619 he writes that '<em>Strong dynamics of QCD induces condensates $\langle \bar \psi_u \psi_u \rangle \approx \langle \bar \psi_d \psi_d \rangle \neq 0$  which spontaneosly break $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R$ down to $SU(2)_{\text{isospin}}$.</em> Thus, in the low energy theory, particles only form multiplets of $SU(2)_{\text{isospin}}$.'</p>

<p>I am trying to understand what is the relevance of the non vanishing VEV of the quark operators $\bar q q$ to imply SSB of the chiral symmetry group? In the chiral lagrangian above, there is no operator of the form $\bar q q$ since the mass term has been set to zero. </p>

<p>My understanding is that SSB of a symmetry means that the lagrangian of the theory exhibits the symmetry but the ground state of the theory does not. In this case our theory is chiral QCD described by the lagrangian at the top of this post . Are we then adding the term $\bar q q m$ onto the chiral lagrangian which can be seen as the analogous term of the Higgs potential like in SSB of free scalar field theories?  The VEV of all terms are then taken and $\langle \bar q q \rangle$ is seen to be non vanishing? The ground state VEV is thus non zero and writing the $\bar q q$ in terms of left and right handed components we see that this term couples them thus the symmetry is no longer the direct product of two $SU(2)$'s. </p>

<p>Is that way of thinking about it anywhere near correct? The more I think about it the more it seems to me that it describes more of an explicit breaking (chiral symmetry softly broken by masses) than spontaneous breaking. </p>

<p>$$
h = \dfrac{\sigma}{\rho g}
$$</p>

<p>where $\sigma$ is Ultimate tensile strength.</p>

<p>this formula is explained <a href=""https://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/how-high-can-mountains-be/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>As I see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> there is kind of steel with Ultimate tensile strength $2600~\mathrm{MPa}$ and according to this formula it can be 32 km!</p>

<p>As I understand this formula for square or cylindrical shape, like the same width everywhere. But what if we make it in the shape of Eiffel Tower or kind of hyperbolic and etc? Or shape is does not matter and maximum height will be the same?</p>

<p>Or maybe if we build it from sticks with the same shape as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_cubic"" rel=""nofollow"">diamond crystal structure</a> we can build it up to 100 km?</p>

<p>Is there any well know way (formula) to calculate maximum height of the tower of the complicated shapes?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
As I was told, I should use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength"" rel=""nofollow"">Compressive strength</a> instead of Ultimate tensile strength. It looks reasonable. In this case calculation will be the same, only for steel I found value not 2600 MPa, but 300 MPa, but I can take another material from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength#Typical_values"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> with the similar value 2600. and if I take diamond with Compressive Strength 17000 MPa it will give 480 km.</p>

<p>UPDATE2/ANSWER:
Looks like I found answer by myself with help of all your valuable comments. If I use assumptions like Total gravitational force to the basement less or equals breaking force ($\sigma$S) where $\sigma$ - compressive strength and S - area in square meters, I get this formula for cylinder</p>

<p>$$
h \leq \dfrac{\sigma}{\rho g}
$$</p>

<p>some numbers for cylinder:</p>

<p>Steel (300 MPa): 3.75 km</p>

<p>Granite (300 MPa, but less density than steel): 11.5 km</p>

<p>Diamond (17000 MPa): 480 km</p>

<p>ABS Plastic (65 MPa): 6.5 km</p>

<p>Strongest concrete (80 MPa): 3.2 km</p>

<p>Carbon epoxy (up to 1500 MPa): 100 km</p>

<p>but for real building we have to divide it to 2 or 3 to have some ""factor of safety"". In this case only diamond and carbon epoxy can be used.</p>

<p>For cone</p>

<p>$$
h \leq \dfrac{1}{3} \dfrac{\sigma}{\rho g}
$$</p>

<p>numbers will be 3 time more than for cylinder.</p>

<p>For other shape this condition should be met</p>

<p>$$
\sigma \geq \dfrac{\rho g V}{S}
$$</p>

<p>I tried to calculate Exponential cone like this
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwHDd.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwHDd.gif"" alt=""Tower with 100 km height from carbon epoxy and factor of safety 3""></a></p>

<p>which is Solid of revolution of this function</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = r e^{-α x}
$$</p>

<p>where r is basement radius and α is kind of cone steepness. Volume can be calculated by formula from wikipedia article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">Solid of revolution</a>
Looks like for this exponential cone it is possible to build tower of any high from any material, but for materials with low compressive strength, if we take basement r=1 km, desired height 100 km for example, last 70% of the tower it will be very thick (like $10^{-5}$ meters). Of course this kind of needle is not possible to build and it does not make any sense to build. if we accept that final radius at maximum height 100 km equals 0.5 meter, the basement radius for different materials will be like this.</p>

<p>r without ""factor of safety""</p>

<p>Steel (300 MPa): 400 km</p>

<p>Granite (300 MPa, but less density): 42 m</p>

<p>Diamond (17000 MPa): 0.56 m with ""factor of safety"" 5</p>

<p>ABS Plastic (65 MPa): 1.5 km</p>

<p>Strongest concrete (80 MPa): 5000 km</p>

<p>Carbon epoxy (up to 1500 MPa): 0.51 m</p>

<p>if we think about ""factor of safety"" equals 3, as I understand it is standard for this kind of things, we get this numbers</p>

<p>Steel (300 MPa): $10^{14}$ km</p>

<p>Granite (300 MPa, but less density): 230 km</p>

<p>Diamond (17000 MPa): 0.56 m with ""factor of safety"" 5</p>

<p>ABS Plastic (65 MPa): 5500 000 km</p>

<p>Strongest concrete (80 MPa): $10^{17}$ km</p>

<p>Carbon epoxy (up to 1500 MPa): 2 m</p>

<p>In this case we can really build a space elevator with high 100 km from 3 materials Granite, Diamond, Carbon epoxy. Even yearly production of Carbon epoxy will be enough to build it :)</p>

<p>This was an unsolved question from my textbook. The answer given is option a and c.</p>

<p>I could not free the variables like the orbital period and velocity from each other so to reach a point from where I could proceed. I am a class 12$^{\rm th}$ student and would like to get a reasonable explanation using Newtonian mechanics.</p>

<p>Where I got stuck:</p>

<p>The orbital velocity of Earth is given by $V=\sqrt{GM/R}$. So, the velocity and radius are dependent on each other.</p>

<p>Also, the orbital period is $T=2\pi\sqrt{R^3/GM}$.</p>

<p>I am creating a simulation of space objects interacting with each other. To test the strength of gravity, Earth does not orbit the sun but will be pulled into it. The Earth will start slowly, and accelerate. I know the time, initial speed, distance between the two objects at the start of the time, and both objects' masses. This question is different from <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/63590/"">this question</a> because that question assumes that the Earth isn't already accelerating. Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit:
To <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/users/5739/garyp"">garyp</a>, sorry, I didn't want to just repeat the title above, but basically, it's the second offered. ""how to calculate that distance for large (say a month, so that the acceleration will obviously change) intervals of time?""</p>

<p>This is not a homework question, and only mentions that I am creating a simulation so that it is known that I don't want the actual acceleration of Earth or an explanation of why the Earth doesn't fall into the Sun. I wanted an equation of distance fallen over time, which would be useful to the broader community, and to future users. I wasn't the one who tagged it as a homework and exercises question, so sorry about that. </p>

"273298","Representation of the Poincare Group on Spacetime","<p>I've just started working through ""Supersymmetric Gauge Field Theory and String Theory"" by D. Balin and A. Love and I got a question to something right at the beginning. </p>

<p>They are revisiting the Poincare-Group and give the following construction of the generators:</p>

<p>For an infinitesimal translation it is</p>

<p>$$x'^\mu = x^\mu + a^\mu = x^\mu-ia_\lambda(P^\lambda)^\mu$$
and from this they conclude that the generator for translations is given by
$$(P^\lambda)_\mu = i \delta^\lambda_\mu.\tag 1 \label{1}$$
I'm a little confused by this. Aren't the finite translations given by
$$x'^\mu = \text{exp}(-i a_\lambda (P^\lambda)^\mu_\nu) x^\nu$$
and shouldn't the generator therefore read 
$$(P^\lambda)^\mu_\nu = i \delta^\mu_\nu \partial^\lambda \tag{2}$$ In other words, why is the generator not an operator valued matrix (as it would clearly be in my case.)</p>

<p>For Lorentz transformations they give the derivation
$$x'^\mu = x^\rho + \omega^\rho_\sigma x^\sigma =x^\rho-\frac{1}{2} \omega_{\mu\nu}(M^{\mu\nu})^\rho_\sigma x^\sigma$$
and conclude 
$$(M^{\mu \nu})^{\rho \sigma} = i (\eta^{\mu \rho}\eta^{\nu \sigma} - \eta^{\mu \sigma}\eta^{\nu \rho}),\tag 3$$
which I understand a little better, as it at least makes sense with my understanding of generators. But with those two definitions, there is no way to make the commutator relation 
$$[M^{\mu \nu}, P^{\lambda}]=i (\eta^{\nu \lambda} P^\mu -\eta^{\mu \lambda}P^\nu) \tag 4$$work out. How would you even define this commutator, given that the $P^\mu$ in (1) has only one internal index?</p>

<p>On the other hand, to fulfill the commutation relation with the operator in (2) I think you also need the spacetime representation of the Lorentz generator, which is the typical
$$L^{\mu\nu} = i(x^\mu \partial^\nu - x^\nu \partial^\mu).\tag 5$$</p>

<p>So I guess, my question boils down to: if (2) and (5) actually fulfill (4), then what is the translation generator corresponding to (3)? 
Which one of those representation is actually the action of the Poincare group on spacetime? I kind of want to say both but I'm just not sure. </p>

"273299","Anharmonic oscillator on quantum mechanics","<p>I'm studying the following Hamiltonian for an anharmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics:</p>

\end{equation}
with $\vec{A} = (-y, x, 0)$ and $\hat{H} \Psi = \epsilon \Psi$.</p>

<p>Now, I've gone to cylindrical coordinates and separated variables, then assuming $\Psi(\rho , \phi, z) = \Phi(\rho) \, \Phi(z) \, e^{- i M \phi}$, I got for the $z$ component:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\left[ -\frac{\hbar ^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{d z^2} + \frac{m \omega_0 ^2}{2} z^2 - (\epsilon_2 + e E z) \right] \Phi(z) = 0,

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_2 = h \omega_0 (n + 1/2) - \frac{(e E)^2}{2 m \omega_0 ^2}.
\end{equation}</p>

<p><strong>What I've done so far:</strong> </p>

<p>I've assumed that for $ z \rightarrow \infty$, $\Phi(z) \approx e^{ -a z^2}$, and got that $a = m \omega_0/(2 \hbar)$ then, assuming
\begin{equation}
\Phi(z) = F(z) \exp\left[- \frac{m \omega_0}{2 \hbar} z^2\right],
\end{equation}
I get for $F(z)$:
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{dz^2} F(z) + \hbar \omega_0 z \frac{d}{d z} F(z) + \left( \frac{\hbar \omega_0}{2} - \epsilon_2 - e E z\right) F(z) = 0,
\end{equation}
 then I've tried going $\eta = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega_0}{\hbar}} z$, and with the Frobenius Method I got \to a recurrence formula for the coefficients, but It doesn't get to the result, so I think there should be a trick in the middle of the process, or another variable substitution has to be made.</p>

"273309","Apartment house ventilation: will adding supply air solve tobacco smell problem?","<p>For at least two years our life quality has been significantly reduced because our upstairs neighbor is a chain smoker and the smell is coming down to our apartment through ceiling structures. I've had enough and I'm now ready to do any kind of renovation to fix this problem.</p>

<p>The superintendent and a ventilation expert has already been twice, trying to balance the ventilation system so that we wouldn't have low pressure and the upstairs neighbor high pressure. Apparently they are just not able to fix the situation as the smoke/smell is coming down to our apartment.</p>

<p>The apartment house has a motorized exhaust leading to top of the building. In practice our apartment has two active exhaust outlets. They suck the air quite strongly. Then we have 3 supply air holes above windows, 1 passive supply air hole in sauna (leading to outside at the same height). There is also one extra exhaust in the sauna but the suction in that is quite weak. Anyway, no matter how open the supply air holes are adjusted or what we do, the smoke is coming from upstairs to our apartment. Even if windows are open, there is still some smoke coming from up down, though of course not at all times we can keep our windows open.</p>

<p>We are not aloud to put a motor to boost air suction to the main exhausts. Because theoretically that will cause low pressure to all other apartments and all our apartment's adverse smells (such as cooking smells) will then theoretically go to all other apartments.</p>

<p>So far I could not really trust the superintendent or the ventilation expert. What they suggest is a complete renovation on our ceiling or the neighbours floor, to seal all possible holes which leak the smoke. However, that is extremely difficult and expensive as many rooms would have to be ripped open and renovated. </p>

<p>My main question is, if I were to add a motor to the one passive supply inlet, what will the result be? Will that create high pressure in our apartment and where will that high pressure air discharge to? Possible places are: to upstairs neighbor through the leaks in our ceilings, the 3 exhaust outlets in our apartment and theoretically also the inlets above our windows.</p>

"273310","Poisson's equation with altered point charge electric potential","<p>My text poses the following question/answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that the potential between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by $r$ were actually $\frac{q_1q_2e^{-Kr}}{r}$, instead of $\frac{q_1q_2}{r}$, with $K$ very small. What would replace Poisson's equation for the electric potential?</p>
  
  <p>Answer: With the assumption given, Poisson's equation is to be replaced by
  \begin{equation}
\nabla^2\phi - K^2 \phi = -4\pi \rho
\end{equation}
  in Gaussian units where $\rho$ is the charge density.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is not an explanation for why Poisson's equation would be replaced by the above, so I feel like I am missing some understanding of how the $\frac{1}{r}$ potential implies that the potential is $\nabla^2\phi = -4 \pi \rho$, and how this relationship is effected by the altered potential such that we have this solution. Could someone please elaborate how we can reach the solution's conclusion a priori?</p>

<p>As I understand the relationship between $\frac{1}{r}$ and Poisson's equation is that it is the Green's function of the Laplacian such that it produces the correct charge density of a point charge and zero everywhere else, is this somehow to be useful in this derivation?</p>

<p>EDIT: The original book's solution had a typo, the book's solution implies that the Yukawa Potential is the Green's function for the Helmholtz equation when in fact it is the Green's function for the “static Klein-Gordon equation"", I have corrected this sign change in the latest edit. </p>

<p>Twin_2 on earth is also moving relatively ==> $t2 = 2*t1$ (2)</p>

<p>Relative to each of them, respectively, 2-yr of life in space for twin_1 in space ""equals"" to 4-yr of life for twin_2 from twin_1's perspective, according to (1), while 2-yr of life on earth for twin_2 ""equals"" to 4-yr of life for twin_1 from twin_1's perspective, according to (2). </p>

<p>Therefore, from special relativity, the relative time of the twins does not change, but for the whole system (twin_1 + twin_2), the time gets longer (doubles here) than the case where twin_1 does not sail to space.</p>

<p>I, myself, feel confused and somewhere paradoxical, but I cannot tell where and how. </p>

"273380","Seismic Wave modelling: Elastic Wave or Acoustic Wave?","<p>I am a beginner to seismic wave theory. I don't have any one to guide me so I am requesting anyone with the knowledge of the subject to share their opinion about what I believe I understood so far. In the few papers that I read, I understand the following: (Kindly correct me if you disagree)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A shear (secondary wave - no change of volume) is more important to model than the compression (primary wave - no rotation) as it brings more devastation than the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>The elastic wave equation is a better representative of a seismic wave than the acoustic wave equation because simulating it, we propagate both 'p' and 's' waves in the mesh instead of just 'p' which we get from simulating acoustic equation. (p - primary; s- secondary)</p></li>
<li><p>The elastic wave equation also known as Navier's equation of elastodynamics can be multiplied by curl operator to give the Shear wave equation, or it can be multiplied by divergence operator to give the acoustic wave equation. Both shear and acoustic wave equations are very similar except for the expressions for their speed. This expression is what differentiates both the equations and is responsible for the shape that they take. I say this because I found both expressions to be exactly same except that the acoustic wave also uses Lame's parameter $\lambda$ in addition to shear modulus $\mu$ and mass density $\rho$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My main concern is to know which waves are propagating in my mesh if I am simulating the elastodynamic or elastic wave equation. Is it both 'p' and 's'?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

"273383","If mass isn't conserved in an expanding universe, why do we assume atomic spectra are constant?","<p>Of the many ways to write a mass in general relativity (Komar, adm and the like), it seems that none of them are conserved in an expanding universe (or more generally for nonstationary metrics). </p>

<p>There are plausable lines of mathematical reasoning that the energy is transferred to/from the gravitational field, but still the mass of a particular body in and of itself appears to lose/gain energy. </p>

<p>I'm fine with this, until I start reading about determining the redshift of distant celestial bodies. It is assumed that atomic spectra are constant through the cosmological ages..why? It seems like General relativity gives us a roadmap indicating a changing mass, which would clearly effect even a nonrelativistic Schrodinger solution for spectra such as the Rydberg formula for hydrogen:</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{\lambda}=\frac{m_{e}e^{4}}{8\epsilon_{0}^{2}h^{3}c}\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}^{2}}-\frac{1}{n_{2}^{2}}\right)$$</p>

<p>Where $\lambda$
  is the wavelength of radiation emitted/absorbed, $n_{1}$
  and $n_{2}$
  are any positive integers $n_{1}\neq n_{2}$
  ; $n_{1}&lt;n_{2}\;and\;n_{2}&lt;n_{1}$
  implying absorption and emission respectively. 
What is the reasoning for this? I just think it's strange that GR is used to determine redshift, but then not for anything more. I'm probably just missing something.</p>

"273388","Inducing Current by Change in Magnetic Flux","<p>Why does a 'change' in magnetic flux induce a current? If we consider a stationary charge placed in a magnetic field, the charge experiences no force (and hence no subsequent motion) due to the magnetic field as it does not have a magnetic field of its own (at least that's what my textbook says). So then, how can the simple change in magnetic field set a charge in motion. </p>

<p> I've seen an answer to the same question I've posed which says that a changing magnetic flux induces an electric field which sets the charges in motion. However, I've looked up another answer which strongly opposes this and talks about Jefimenko's equations (which I haven't understood in the least)</p>

<p>Let's say the light was traveling through a waveguide over that same distance. Calculations shouldn't be effected, and the redshift would follow the same equation.</p>

<p>If we now take that same waveguide and make it a large circle of the same total length, would that effect the redshift equation? I don't see how, but maybe someone here knows better.</p>

"273422","Are there Optical Magnetic Mirrors (OMMs) which actually reflect via interaction with the magnetic field?","<p>The most familiar mirror relies on reflection from a metal, where the very strong interaction of the electric field component of the EM wave with the conduction electrons produces a reflected wave.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_mirror"" rel=""nofollow"">Dielectric mirrors</a> rely on the weaker interaction of the electric field with bound electrons, and a periodic modulation of the dielectric constant (alternating quarter wave thicknesses) builds up a reflected wave with high efficiency.</p>

<p>The paper <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1464-4258/9/1/L01/meta"" rel=""nofollow"">Optical Magnetic Mirrors</a> (Schwanecke et al. 2007 J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 9 L1) begins with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report the first demonstration of an optical magnetic mirror achieved by nanostructuring a metal surface. It reverses the magnetic field of an incident wave upon reflection, acting as an ‘optical frequency superconductor’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The introduction goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A magnetic mirror imposes extremely unusual electromagnetic boundary conditions: it does not reverse the electric field of a light wave upon reflection, but reverses the magnetic field. This property renders it distinctly different from a normal mirror, which instead reverses the electric field of a reflected wave...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so the working definition of a magnetic mirror here seems to be a surface which produces a reflection without reversing the direction of the electric field, <em>but instead reversing the direction of the magnetic field</em>. </p>

<p>However it's not clear to me if this is due to the interaction with the magnetic field directly.</p>

<p>In the paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1308"" rel=""nofollow"">Optical Magnetic Mirrors without Metals</a> (also <a href=""https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-1-4-250"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> Liu et al. 2014, Vol. 1, No. 4, 250) a nano-patterned purely dielectric surface is said to be an Optical Magnetic Mirror (OMM). I understand that the effect is due resonant modes within the dielectric patterns, and some of these modes are called 'electric' and some 'magnetic' as a naming convention, somewhat like there are TE and TM modes in a dielectric fiber waveguide. However, <em>aren't these still due to the interaction of the electric field</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Are there surfaces, or relatively thin nano-structures which reflect light <em>via interaction with the magnetic field</em> of the wave? Is there a physics distinction between that magnetic interaction, and a patterned surface that simply passes the test of not inverting the electric field?</p>

"273423","How is the ""normalisation"" of non-normalizable states chosen?","<p>This question is about non-normalisable states in quantum mechanics, e.g. the eigenstates of the position operator $|x\rangle$ which are defined by the eigenvalue equation</p>

<p>$$\tag{1} \hat{X}|x\rangle = x|x\rangle.$$</p>

<p>Since the spectrum of the operator is continuous, the states are not square normalisable. Instead one has an equation such as</p>

<p>$$\tag{2} \langle x'|x\rangle = \delta(x-x')$$</p>

<p>which gives the overlap meaning as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"">distribution</a>. However it is clear that there is still at least an ambiguity in choosing a constant, i.e. why no have</p>

<p>$$\langle x'|x\rangle = a \times \delta(x-x')$$</p>

<p>where $a$ is $a \in \mathbb{R} $.</p>

<hr>

<p>So I went to see how Equation (2) is derived. In Schleich's textbook on quantum optics in phase space I found the following, very short and in my opinion not clear/complete derivation.</p>

<p>From Equation (1) which can be taken to be the definition of the position operator and the assumption that the operator is <strong>hermitian</strong> which is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics one obtains:</p>

<p>$$\tag{3} \left( x - x' \right) \langle x'|x\rangle = 0.$$</p>

<p>That was easy so far, but then Schleich jumps immediately to equation (2). But the solutions for $\langle x'|x\rangle$ of (3) are all functions/generalised functions that are non-zero everywhere except at $x=x'$. So my question is: <strong>Why is (2) the unique solution? Where does the additional information come from?</strong></p>

<p>My suspicion is that we impose another requirement, which is probably the completeness of the states, which would make (2) clear since it is the identity element in the position representation.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, no ""all optical"" clock (one which uses no oscillating atoms or electronics in the signal creation process) has been created and put through sustained acceleration in order to directly test the theory of time dilation - they all appear to involve control electronics or atoms which may be distorting the results.</p>

<p><strong>(Rough!) Optical clock design - a feedback loop using optical interference</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/12Sej.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/12Sej.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This clock uses interference in order to make an optical pulse train (a clock signal) at point A. It can be followed through like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The laser light passes through the splitter</li>
<li>It bounces around the mirrors</li>
<li>It interferes with itself at the splitter and cancels out</li>
<li>The dark beam goes 'around' the mirrors</li>
<li>It's no longer interfering with itself; the output brightens again</li>
<li>Repeat. The signal oscillates between bright and dark at a frequency determined by the distance around the mirrors</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, place this on a small satellite such that signal A can be read from Earth with minimal additional timing electronics on board. Compare the tick rate with a clock on Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong>
Maybe atomic clocks are flawed. Atoms are expected to increase in mass at high speeds so this could be changing their oscillation period or affects decay length.</p>

<p><strong>Relativity theory</strong></p>

<p>From the point of view of the satellite, the ticking occurs normally. From the point of view of Earth, the ticks would gradually slow down as satellite speed increases.</p>

<p><strong>A counter theory</strong></p>

<p>The Universe entirely ignores atom velocity when a photon is emitted from it; <em>c is still constant</em>. From either Earth or the satellite, the ticks would continue at the same rate but would reach a point at which the clock breaks down when the mirrors fall out of alignment. At extreme speeds, the first mirror has essentially moved out of the way before the light could bounce off it. As a side note, colour shifting does still appear to hold.</p>

<p>The important distinction is that at LEO speeds there is a measurable difference.</p>

<p>So, the question itself: <strong>Would such an experiment be worthwhile? What am I missing?</strong></p>

"273436","(How) does the precession period of a gyroscope change if the motor is turned on throughout?","<p>I'm doing experiment with a gyroscope, varying a distance of a supplementary mass from the rotation axis (which is represented as $r^*$ in the picture) and measuring the precession period. The supplementary mass is the mass hanging from the axis, additional to the counter mass (which is $C$ in the picture), where the counter mass is the mass that makes the gyroscope be in equilibrium. I'm using an electronic motor to make the disk keep rotating over one single precession period. </p>

<p>My question is, does the physics of the gyroscope still works in the same way even the motor is turned on over the whole period, as compared with the case without the motor? I ask because I found that most papers on gyroscope experiments don't use the motor over the whole period. Does the equation below still hold in the same way?</p>

<p>Specifically, the precession and rotation periods $t_P$ and $t_R$ (resp.) are meant to be related via
$$
\frac{1}{t_R} = \frac{m^*gr^*}{4\pi^2I_p}t_P
$$
where $m^*$ is the mass of the supplementary mass, $r^*$ is the distance of the supplementary mass from the centre, and $I_p$ is the moment of inertia of the disk. Does this still hold with the motor turned on?</p>

<p>Could it be that dark matter is actually the fabric of the universe itself i.e. Space? If so, could this explain why we cannot measure it directly – if every known thing is made of ‘space’ we would have no relative medium to measure it against. </p>

<p>Furthering this concept, if we were to suppose that dark energy decays to dark matter as a function of temperature, we know the universe is cooling whilst expanding at an accelerating rate, one could hypothesise that as the universe cools, the rate of decay (dark energy to dark matter) increases and hence, the rate of expansion increases.  </p>

<p>In a latter chapter in her book, when she talks about recombination and decoupling, where matter and radiation clearly interact, she also states that the number density of matter falls like $a^{-3}$.

"273473","Torque in Feynman lectures mismatch with my derivation","<p>It is about <a href=""http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this lecture</a> in the section 20-3 ""The gyroscope"". There, Feynman derives the torque on that gyroscope as $\tau = \Omega \times L_0$. </p>

<p>My derivation is a little different: I compute the angular momentum in the world coordinate system as: $(L_0)_w = I_B \cdot (\omega)_w$. After the system is rotated around $x$ axis the angular momentum in the rotated coordinate system will be $(L_1)_b = I_B \cdot (\omega)_b$. Of course $\omega$ is the same vector in their corresponding coordinate system and this angular momentum in the world coordinate system is $(L_1)_w = R^T \cdot (L_1)_b$ The torque is $$\tau = lim_{dt \rightarrow 0} \frac{(L_1)_w - (L_0)_w}{dt} = lim_{dt \rightarrow 0}\frac{(R^T - I_3)}{dt} \cdot I_B\cdot \omega\\ = \dot{R}^T \cdot (L_0)_w \\ =\dot{R}^T \cdot (L_1)_b $$. R is the rotation matrix around $x$ axis here. One can obtain $\Omega$ with $\dot{R}^T = [\Omega] \cdot R^T$ where $[\Omega] \cdot (L_1)_b = \Omega \times (L_1)_b$. Replacing above I obtain $$ \tau = [\Omega] \cdot R^T\cdot (L_1)_b = [\Omega] \cdot (L_1)_w \\ = \Omega \times (L_1)_w$$ which is different  Why? I also noted that Feyman says there that $\Delta L= L_0 \cdot \theta$ but I think it should be $\Delta L= L_0 \cdot sin(\theta)$. Is it just an approximation then it's formula? </p>

<p>As he starts rubbing the groves vigorously, the paper propeller starts spinning <b>clockwise</b>.</p>

<p>The mysterious thing is this: torque is generated on the paper from just translational motion (the rubbing of the grooves)! Where does this torque come from?! My current hypothesis is that the pencil traces a small circle if you hold it with your hand while rubbing the grooves, but I've disproved this theory when I mounted a replicated device on a clamp and performed the rubbing - the rotations still happens! I've ran computer simulations on this and have yet to determine the origins of the torque, which means the torque generation lies in non-ideality. An ideal system will dissipate the vibrational energy perfectly, generating no torque.</p>

<p>How can sound waves in a wooden media generate any torque as it leaves through a pivoted rigid body (the paper propeller)?</p>

"273505","Is an interaction-free measurement an irreversible process?","<p>From what I've understood from reading different online sources including PSE*, measurements in quantum mechanics are generally argued to be irreversible (at least, when a macroscopic measuring device is used). This irreversibility is usually ascribed to an increase in total entropy (measured system $+$ measuring device) that occurs when the measurement is made. Quoting from the article <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0002048.pdf"" rel=""nofollow""><em>""Irreversibility and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics""</em></a> by Douglas M. Snyder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bohr (1935) maintained that quantum mechanical measurement also depended on the interaction between a macroscopic measuring instrument and the physical existent measured. He noted that when a macroscopical physical measuring apparatus is used, there is inevitably some loss of information concerning the measured system due to the resulting physical interaction. [...] For Bohr, once the information is lost in the measurement process, the measurement cannot be reversed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this description only accounts for interaction-based measurements. What could we say about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction-free_measurement"" rel=""nofollow"">interaction-free measurements</a>, then? (See the Wikipedia article for examples).

<p>In special relativity, the time component of four-velocity, in terms of the spacial components, is:</p>

<p>$$u^0=\frac{dx^0}{d\tau}=\frac{cdt}{d\tau}=\sqrt{c^2+|u^i|^2} \hspace{4em} (3)$$</p>

<p>where $|u^i|^2 = (u^1)^2+(u^2)^2+(u^3)^2$ is the magnitude squared of the spacial components of the four-velocity. This comes from the Minkowskian metric. Then I derived a similar equation from the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates:</p>

<p>$$u^0=\frac{cdt}{d\tau}=\sqrt{\frac{B}{A}(c^2+B^2|u^i|^2)} \hspace{4em} (4)$$</p>

<p>where $A=(1-\frac{GM}{2R})^2$ and $B=(1+\frac{GM}{2R})^2$. If this is correct, it's quite straightforward to find that the latter definition gives a greater value than the one from special relativity, since $B &gt; 1$ and $B &gt; A$. Does this mean that the four-velocity magnitude is not constant in General Relativity, as it depends also on radial distance? (I knew that the four-velocity always equals the speed of light)</p>

"273536","Do plane waves exist in nature?","<p>Drop a stone in the pond...a wave propagates radially from the source. The conservation of energy says the wave must decay proportionally to the radial distance.

If the energy must still decay radially, then how do plane waves ever form?</p>

<p>I know we can generate them in labs and obviously express the math, but in nature, do plane waves really exist?</p>

<p>OK...so let's assume it was an infinitely long I-beam. Then I guess you could argue you get plane waves. But look at the assumptions: 1) infinite I-beams don't exist (nothing is infinite) and 2) you have to assume there are ZERO irregularities in the I-beam. These concepts are purely mathematical.</p>

<p>OK...OK....you're ""zooming in"" on the radial wave and it appears like a plane wave. But do you account for the fact that the wave must always be decaying in time (assume there is no external dissipation involved)?</p>

<p>The book says that whenever an object goes through a round friction less track the work done by gravitational field is zero. This ultimately means that body comes at the starting point with the same velocity with which it went away. Now, if the body comes with a smaller velocity (negative work) or a bigger velocity (positive work) it can go round and round on the track producing a perpetual motion which can never take place according to conservation of energy. Now, as far as I know, perpetual motion is a motion which carries on for indefinite time. So if the work done is zero also, then too the body would continue its motion on the track without any problem, moving round and round making an indefinite motion. Doesn't that too provides a perpetual motion? Moreover what kind of new perpetual motion would come if the body would have negative or positive work done.

<p>Here also I face one doubt. (a) One ball is there at a height of one feet and then we push it ahead to the hand of the lever (b) (assuming no change in energy as the height is same). In (c) the ball lifts the other three balls up by a distance $x$ itself coming down by a  distance of  $1$ foot. In  (d) we unload the balls and what we can actually see is that two of the balls indeed are at the same point while we can view the motion as that of ascent of the lowest all to a height of $3x$. Now Mr. Feynman says that $3x = 1ft$ only otherwise if there is a gap of energy that it can go on for perpetual motion. Now I don't understand what kind of perpetual motion is he talking about here. As the balls can still be there is the perpetual (indefinite) motion as we can rearrange the balls  assuming no change in energy as they are at same height. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Faraday effect has been known for a long time. It refers to the
  polarization plane of an electromagnetic wave propagating through a
  non-magnetic medium, which is rotating in the presence of a constant
  magnetic field. There is also an inverse process of the generation of
  a magnetic field during the propagation of a circularly polarized wave
  through a crystal or plasma. It was considered theoretically in the
  1960s by Soviet theorist Lew Pitaevsky, a famous representative of
  Landau's school. The stronger the wave, the higher the magnetic field
  it can generate when propagating through a medium. However, a
  peculiarity of the effect is that it requires absorption for its very
  existence—it does not occur in entirely transparent media. In highly
  intense electromagnetic fields, electrons become ultrarelativistic,
  which considerably reduces their collisions, suppressing conventional
  absorption. The researchers demonstrate that at very high laser wave
  intensities, the absorption can be effectively provided by <strong>radiation
  friction</strong> instead of binary collisions. This specific friction leads to
  the generation of a superstrong magnetic field.</p>

<p>$\bullet$ If in an inertial frame $S$, $p^0$ is positive, then it is inferred that under proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation (i.e., those Lorentz transformations which are continuously connected to identity) $p^0$ does not change sign. However, the way in which $p^0$ changes from frame S to frame $S^\prime$ is given by $$p^{0\prime}=\Lambda^{0}{}_{0}p^0+\Lambda^{0}{}_{1}p^1+\Lambda^{0}{}_{2}p^2+\Lambda^{0}{}_{3}p^3$$ with the constraints $\Lambda^{0}{}_{0}\geq 1$ and $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}(\Lambda^{0}{}_{i})^2\geq 0$. Though $p^0&gt;0$, there is no such constraint on $p^1,p^2$ and $p^3$ which can be negative. Therefore, I don't understand why <em>cannot</em> $p^{0\prime}$ change sign? </p>

<p>$\bullet$ On the other hand, the assertion that $p^0$ does not change sign seems correct because it is crucial to prove that the integral $\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{E_p}$ is Lorentz invariant.

<p>However, the situation will change around 2018, when the currently proposed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units"" rel=""nofollow"">redefinition of the SI units</a> comes into effect, essentially making all SI units dependent on seven invariants of nature. I am puzzled by the role of base constants in this new system: what are they, and is there any reason other than historical continuity to even keep the concept around?</p>

<p>To be a bit more explicit, let me concentrate on the role of the ampere, because this is the craziest one. In the new SI, the ampere is retained as a base unit, and electric current is retained as a base quantity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The base quantities used in the SI are time, length, mass, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. The corresponding base units of the SI were chosen by the CGPM to be the second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela</p>
  
  <p>(<a href=""http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_draft_ch123.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Proposed draft of the new SI brochure</a> (pdf), §1.2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but in essence it is defined as the amount of current that will make the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge"" rel=""nofollow"">elementary charge</a> equal to $e=1.602\,176\,565×10^{-19}\:\mathrm{C} =1.602\,176\,565×10^{-19} \:\mathrm{A\:s}$ (with the exact number replaced with whatever CODATA says is our best measurement at the time of the redefinition).</p>

<p>Compare this with the current definition of the SI ampere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight
  parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these
  conductors a force equal to 2 × 10<sup>−7</sup> newton per metre of length. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given a standard for force, this directly defines the ampere with no strings attached. The new definition, however, mostly just defines the coulomb as a fixed number of elementary charges, and then hinges on the definition of the second to define the ampere. Shouldn't this make the coulomb the base unit?</p>

<hr>

<p>Going a bit further from this, the actual implementations make the picture even more muddled. I documented them in <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/147433/what-are-the-proposed-realizations-in-the-new-si-for-the-kilogram-ampere-kelvi"">this question and answer</a>, but the short story with the ampere is that the implementation mainly hinges on two well-understood physical effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hall_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">quantum Hall effect</a>, which essentially establishes a quantum of conductance when an electron gas is confined at low temperatures to a two-dimensional material. The resistance then comes in (sub)multiples of the von Klitzing constant, $R_K=h/e^2\approx 26\:\mathrm{kΩ}$, so a quantum Hall effect experiment essentially gives a ready-baked resistance standard.</p></li>
<li><p>The other is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">Josephson effect</a>, which you get when you put together two superconductors separated by a thin insulating barrier (called a Josephson junction). In its AC form, if you subject the junction to a constant DC voltage $V$, because of quantum mechanical effects the junction will let through an alternating current of frequency $\nu=K_JV$, where $K_J=2e/h\approx 484\mathrm{\:THz/V}$ is the Josephson constant. Thus, if you have a frequency standard to compare with, you get a ready-made voltage standard.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OK, so that was a bit of a rant, but really: am I missing something? Is there <em>any</em> reason, beyond historical continuity, to even keep the concept of a base quantity/unit around? If we do need the concept, why not keep it as the seven fixed constants? (With the alarming feature, of course, that mass would no longer be a base dimension - it would be replaced by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">action</a>.) Do we just want it as a convenient base for the <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/174521/is-0-mathrmm-dimensionless/174529#174529"">vector space of physical quantities</a>? Why do we even need a canonical base for it? And if we do need it, wouldn't the coulomb be equally useful there?</p>

where $\mathrm{d} \mu(p)$ is Lorentz invariant volume element on mass shell $p^2 =m^2,$ $p^0&gt;0$. Under parity this field transforms to
$$ \phi_P(x) = P \phi(x)P^{\dagger} = \int \mathrm{d}\mu(p) \left( \eta^* a(p) e^{-ipx} + \eta a^{\dagger}(p) e^{ipx}\right),$$
where $\eta$ is intrinsic parity of the particle created and annihilated by $\phi$, $|\eta|=1$. It is easy to see that in order for $\phi_P$ to commute with $\phi$ for spacelike related points one needs to have $\eta = \pm 1$. This is the argument which is invoked in Weinberg's textbook to conclude that this must be the case and all spin $0$ particles have parity $\pm 1$. In this case $\phi_P=\eta \phi$. It seems that this assumption is made in most texts on QFT.

"273702","Lorentz Force and Larmor radius","<p>I have the following exercise: I have a charge (q) accelerated by a potential difference ($ \Delta V$) which enters a region in which a magnetic uniform field is present (the field is not know).

<p>That's my idea:
The electrostatic field is conservative so I can write this:

so: $ 1/2 m v^2 = q\Delta V =&gt; v^2 = 2q\Delta V / m $</p>

"273710","Why does atmospheric water vapor need dust particles to fall as rain?","<p>I appreciate that rain can fall due to the process of coalescence described below, but I was under the impression that nucleation based around atmospheric dust particles was a vital part of the process, and is responsible for most rain showers.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"">Wikipedia Rainfall</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets. Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing, and is also known as the warm rain process.</p>
  
  <p>In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.</p>

"273711","Dimensional analysis in differential equations","<p>I know how to use Buckingham Pi Theorem to, for example derive from the functional equation for a simple pendelum, with the usual methods also described <a href=""https://projects.exeter.ac.uk/fluidflow/Courses/FluidDynamics3211-2/DimensionalAnalysis/dimensionalLecturese4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>$1=fn\left[T_{period}, m, g, L\right]$</p>

<p>$1=fn\left[\frac{g}{L}T_{period}^2\right]=fn\left[\Pi_1\right]$</p>

<p>Everything seemed to work well until I tried to apply the theorem to the governing differential equation:</p>

<p>$(I): m\frac{d^2\Theta}{dt^2}L = - sin(\Theta)mg$</p>

<p>$1 = fn\left[\Theta, m, g, L, t\right]$</p>

<p>$1 = fn\left[\Theta, \frac{g}{L}t^2\right] = fn\left[\Theta, \Pi_1\right]$</p>

<p>Seems to work so far, but when I now try to rewrite $I$ in terms of $\Theta, \Pi_1$, I can't deal with the derivative.</p>

<hr>

<p>I tried something myself and it <em>seems</em> to work out, but I don't know how rigorous the argumentation is and if the result can be stated in a better way. See the following:</p>

<p>Since we want to take a derivative with respect to time, we define a new dimensional variable $\xi$ with $\xi\bar{t} = t$ with arbitrary $\bar{t} \neq 0$. We also introduce a new function $\Omega\left(\xi\right) = \Theta\left(\xi\bar{t}\right)=\Theta\left(t\right)$. Computing $\frac{d\Omega}{d\xi} = \bar{t}\Theta\left(\xi\bar{t}\right)=\bar{t}\Theta\left(t\right)$ and likewise for higher derivatives.</p>

<p>We now write the functional equation including derivatives like so</p>

<p>$1 = fn\left[\frac{d^2\Theta}{dt^2}, \Theta, m, g, L, t\right]$</p>

<p>substituting $t=\xi\bar{t}, \frac{d^2\Theta}{dt^2}=\frac{1}{\bar{t}^2}\frac{d^2\Omega}{d\xi^2}, \Theta=\Omega$ we have the new functional equation</p>

<p>$1 = fn\left[\frac{1}{\bar{t}^2}\frac{d^2\Omega}{d\xi^2}, \Omega, m, g, L, \bar{t}, \xi\right]$</p>

<p>because the derivative is now in terms of two nondimensional parameters, everything else seems to work great with Buckingham Pi:</p>

<p>$1 = fn\left[\frac{d^2\Omega}{d\xi^2}, \Omega, \frac{g}{L}\bar{t}^2, \xi\right] = fn\left[\frac{d^2\Omega}{d\xi^2}, \Omega, \Pi_2, \xi\right]$</p>

<p>When resubstituting in the actual equation we get</p>

<p>$\frac{d^2\Omega}{d\xi^2} = -sin\left(\Omega\right)\Pi_2$</p>

<p>which indeed yields the correct results.</p>

<hr>

<p>Although I can't seem to find any mistakes in my reasoning, I am not quite happy with the arbitrary choice of $\bar{t}$. The choice <em>does</em> influence the \Pi-group 2 (although only in magnitude) and also <em>will</em> influence boundary conditions when they are given. As far as I can see, it does not influence the result, when given in natural parameter form (as terms of $m, g, L, t$) because every $\bar{t}$ will get paired again with one $\xi$, yielding just $t$. But I have not been able to prove this point.</p>

<hr>

<p>I remain with three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the standard approach in literature that I can study?</li>
<li>Is there a problem with my derivations, so far?</li>
<li>Can I somehow prove that the choice of $\bar{t}$ does not matter in the final solution?</li>

<p>I initially thought that as the magnet moves, eddy currents will be induced directly under where the magnet poles just moved away from, to make a magnetic field in the same direction as the pole that just moved, by Lenz's law.

where $c^{a},\overline{c}^{a}$are ghost fields and $B^{a}$ is a Nakanishi-Lautrup field.This is Lorentz and $L_{matter}$ is gauge invariant.(Gauge group is assumed to be semisimple) </p>

<p>Let the two point Green's function in momentum space$$\int \mathrm{d}x e^{-ip(x-y)}&lt;0|TA_{\mu}^{a}(x)B_{\nu}^{b}(y)|0&gt; \equiv f_{\mu}^{ab}(p) $$( this is a notation I introduced here just for simplicity. )</p>

<p>It seems to me that he derives $f_{\mu}^{ab}(p)=-\delta^{ab}p_{\mu}/p^2$ only from $p^{\mu}f_{\mu}^{ab}(p)=-\delta^{ab}$ because  we know $f_{\mu}^{ab}(p)$is proportional to  $p_{\mu}$ from symmetry . I don't get explanation for this.(or maybe this is wrong.)</p>

<p>this may be very trivial fact but I can't understand it. Can we put such a strong condition only from Lorentz invariance?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us note that in quantum physics there can be more general symmetries which are not described by groups anymore. The presence of such symmetries can be understood as follows. In quantum physics, the commutative algebra of functions on the configuration space is traded for a non-commutative algebra of operators. Now for a classical dynamical system the symmetries can be viewed as acting on the points of the configuration space, hence they form a group, with the group multiplication provided by the composition of maps. In contrast, in quantum physics the configuration space is no longer present, so that this argument does not apply anymore. </p>

<p>I am a bit confused by the authors' argument here. For quantum physics, we still have the Hilbert space on which we can view the operators act. What's the significance here for the existence of configuration space?

"273780","How to interpret correlation functions in QFT?","<p>I'm fairly new to the subject of quantum field theory (QFT), and I'm having trouble intuitively grasping what a n-point correlation function physically describes. For example, consider the 2-point correlation function between a (real) scalar field $\hat{\phi}(x)$ and itself at two different space-time points $x$ and $y$, i.e. $$\langle\hat{\phi}(x)\hat{\phi}(y)\rangle :=\langle 0\rvert T\lbrace\hat{\phi}(x)\hat{\phi}(y)\rbrace\lvert 0\rangle\tag{1}$$ where $T$ time-orders the fields.</p>

<p>Does this quantify the correlation between the values of the field at $x=(t,\mathbf{x})$ and $y=(t',\mathbf{y})$ (i.e. how much the values of the field at different space-time points covary, in the sense that, if the field $\hat{\phi}$ is excited at time $t$ at some spatial point $\mathbf{x}$, then this will influence the ""behaviour"" of the field at later time $t'$ at some spatial point $\mathbf{y}$)? Is this why it is referred to as a correlation function?</p>

<p>Furthermore, does one interpret $(1)$ as physically describing the amplitude of propagation of a $\phi$-particle from $x$ to $y$ (in the sense that a correlation of excitations of the field at two points $x$ and $y$ can be interpreted as a ""ripple"" in the field propagating from $x$ to $y$)?</p>

<p>Looking specifically at the uncertainty principle, the product of the precisions of position and momentum (or energy and time) must be greater than or equal to some lower limit (Planck’s constant over 2).  Imagine that you took a bit of precision away from position (reducing its certainty by a factor of two) and gave it to momentum (doubling its certainty), then you’d get the same maximum precision.  If you took into account Planck temperature (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_hot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_hot</a>), it might be possible to postulate a total number bits that could represent these quantities.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>My understanding of the problem tells me that the system has only $1$ degree of freedom, $\theta$, since the center of mass moves in a circle of fixed radius in a fixed plane. So there must be only one generalised co-ordinate. Now if I consider that the position vectors of the $2$ point masses are $\vec r_1$ and $\vec r_2$ respectively,then the constraints of the system are
$$\lvert\vec r_2-\vec r_1\rvert=l$$ $$\left\lvert\frac{\vec r_2+\vec r_1}{2}\right\rvert=a$$</p>

<p>But I cannot find out the generalised co-ordinate from here on. Can you tell me if I am right about the degrees of freedom of the system? And am I on the right track? How should I proceed?</p>

<p>Also, one more thing is that there is nothing written if the masses are rotating about their center of mass. Do I have to make a special case for it? </p>

In an effort to learn more about this $\star$, I figured out that the theory consists of the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge vector multiplet along with an adjoint hypermultiplet of mass $m$. I have a number of questions about such a construction:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: In what sense is this  <em>mass deformation</em> of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory? </p>

<p>The $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM multiplet consists of an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ vector multiplet and an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ hypermultiplet, and if you make the hypermultiplet infinitely massive, it is tantamount to integrating the hypermultiplet out, yielding an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SYM. In the opposite limit (of taking the mass to zero), one gets back $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM. Is this all one means by a mass deformation?</p>

<p>The context of my question is the so called twisted compactification of (a stack of) M5-branes on $S^1$ which leads to this five-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2^\star$ theory.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2jZLt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2jZLt.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My answers:</p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Using the conservation of momentum ($u$ being velocity before collision and $U$ being velocity after collision):</p>

<p>$$
m_ou_o + m_xu_x = m_oU_o + m_xU_x
$$</p>

<p>Since 'x' object stops after collision in figure (a) [top], $U_x = 0m/s$:
$$
m_ou_o + m_xu_x = m_oU_o + 0
$$
$$
m_x = \frac{m_o(U_o - u_o)}{u_x}
$$
According to the diagram, we see that $u_o = U_0 = u_x = 5m/s$:
$$
m_x = \frac{1kg(5m/s - 5m/s)}{5m/s} = 0???
$$
Something is not right here. The only way this would seem to me to make sense would be where the frame suddenly begins to move immediately after the collision, and we can account for some of the velocity with the moving frame, but the question clearly states that one of the frames, either (a) or (b), is continuously moving with a uniform speed. Momentum is conserved for ALL inertial frames.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Again, plugging values into the conservation of momentum equation, using the velocities found in figure (b) [bottom], things don't add up:</p>

<p>$$
0.72m_o + 0.38m_x = 0.51m_o + 0.38m_x
$$</p>

<p>Is there something I'm doing wrong or not understanding, or are the diagrams not accurate?</p>

"273871","Rotating a wavefunction to get an exponential of $L^2$ and $L_z$","<p>With the canonical choices of directions etc, assuming the quantum mechanical wavefunction $\Psi$ is an eigenfunction of the angular momentum operator $L_z$, we can express a rotation of angle $\alpha$ around the $z$-axis in terms of an exponential of $L_z$:</p>

<p>$R_z(\alpha)\Psi=\exp(-i\alpha L_z)\Psi$.</p>

<p>Further assuming that $\Psi$ is an eigenfunction of $L^2$, is there a rotation (potentially including all three directions) that lead to an exponential of $L^2$ (and possibly $L_z$)?</p>

<p>I assumed there would be a way to express a general rotation in this way, i.e. something like</p>

<p>$R_x(\alpha)R_y(\beta)R_z(\gamma)\Psi=\exp\big(-if(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,L^2,L_z)\big)\Psi$,</p>

<p>where $f$ is linear in $L_z$ and $L^2$, but I haven't been able to find it.</p>

<p>Note that the question is not about finding an expression for the general rotation but about finding <em>any</em> rotation that can be expressed as an exponential that includes $L^2$ and possibly $L_z$ but no other operators or powers of these (and nothing like $0\cdot L^2$).</p>

"273937","Why is spin-orbit splitting larger in heavier atoms?","<p>Spin-orbit interaction is the interaction of an electron's spin with the magnetic moment generated by the orbital motion of the electron. Or, from the point of view of an electron, it is the interaction between electron's spin and orbital motion of the nucleus. 
And, for different atoms, the spin-orbital splitting of energy levels was found to be different. And the trend is that for heavier atoms the splitting is larger. I do not completely see why is that so qualitatively... Let's consider only the valence electrons. The heavier the atom, the more electrons it has and the more electrons are there in between the valence electrons and the nucleus, and the more efficient the screening effect. The last, as I understand, means that the Coulomb interaction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is largely reduced. And reduction is larger for the heavier elements. But larger spin-splitting should mean stronger interaction, right?
So why is the spin-orbit splitting larger in heavier atoms?</p>

<p>Calculating the torque each force applies separately yields that the rod will rotate counter-clockwise from  F1 and clockwise from F2, but since they are equal, the rotation cancels out.</p>

<p>In real life, the rod will be pushed forward, and if only one force were to act, it would only rotate. How do we work this out? I've looked everywhere (well, with the limited terminology i know) and there is no mention of how to calculate linear acceleration from 2 separate forces that cancel out (completely or incompletely). </p>

<p>This is a simple problem and my intuition tells me that the rod will accelerate as if the two forces were to act on the center of mass, but what if it gets more complicated? what if the forces act on arbitrary locations relative to the center of mass of another rigid body, for example like this:

  <p><em>The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source</em> [consenus definition on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">the english wikipedia page
  </a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""... light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity [speed] c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body""</em> [A. Einstein]</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>They define <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_synchronisation"" rel=""nofollow"">Einstein synchronisation</a> which relies on the knowledge/assumption that the speed of light is everywere constant</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem that I see is this one:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The postulate is speaking about any measure of ""speed"" and the meaning of (mean) ""speed"" is supposed to be $\Delta s/\Delta t$ (as far as the reader knows) where $\Delta t=t_1-t_2$, $t_1$ and $t_2$ being two measured times. If the times $t_1$ and $t_2$ are measured in two different positions we need to know in advance how to syncronise distant clocks but we don't know yet and we will know how to do it only afterwards: with Einstein synchronisation. But Einstein syncronisation relies on the postulate itself: it <em>assumes</em> that the ""speed"" of light is constant. This seems to produce a logical circularity: speed of light is (obviously) constant just because we define synchronisation in order to make it ""artificially"" constant? (*)</p></li>
<li><p>And what is the postulate actually telling us? We don't know what is ""speed"" yet since we don't know how to define <em>time</em> for spatially distant places. Maybe the postulate is supposed to be linked with Einstein synchronisation in order to define what is ""speed""?</p></li>
<li><p>What actually <em>is</em> speed/velocity on a general (non circular) path when we drop absolute time? Before postulating anything about speed of light we need in the first place to know what speed is, and the definition shouldn't rely on the use of the notion of velocity itself that is the case with Einstein's synchronisation!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone clarify this issue?</p>

<p>(*) I know the M-M experiment proved that speed of light is constant when measured as an average in a closed path with mirrors but I would say it doesn't say anything about the speed of light in any non-closed interval of the path.</p>

<p>If it is possible, I would like to use pulse compression to generate $1\ \text{nanosecond}$ duration pulses from $1\ \text{microsecond}$ laser pulses in order to reduce  the required $340\ \text{kilovolts per centimeter}$ DC or AC  electric field strengths. </p>

<p>In Dr. Arbore's article, the Stanford University researchers use second harmonic generation in chirped quasi-phase matching diffraction gratings to compress $17\ \text{picosecond}$ duration pulses to $110\ \text{femtosecond}$ duration pulses. I wish to find out why all the literature searches I have done discuss pulse compression of ultrafast pulsed lasers only when the pulse duration of that laser is in the realm of picoseconds and below.</p>

<p>We are using a simple pulsed CO2 laser with long pulse duration of millisecond order in a tube at a low pressure of less than $30\ \text{torr}$. The power supply for our laser system switches the voltage of the AC power line ($60\ \mathrm{Hz}$) directly. The power supply does not need elements such as a rectifier bridge, energy-storage capacitors, or a current-limiting resistor in the discharge circuit. In order to control the laser output power, the pulse repetition rate is adjusted up to $60\ \mathrm{Hz}$ and the firing angle of the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) gate is varied from $30°$  to $150°$.  The maximum laser output of $35\ \mathrm{W}$ is obtained at a total pressure of $18\ \text{torr}$, a pulse repetition rate of $60\ \mathrm{Hz}$, and a SCR gate firing angle of $90°$. In addition, the resulting laser pulse width is approximately $3\ \mathrm{ms}$ (full width at half maximum). This is a relatively long pulse width, compared with other repetitively pulsed CO2 lasers.</p>

<p>The amorphous semiconductor used by the Stanford University researchers was first used by  Dr Stanford R. Ovshinsky Ph.D. The problem that held back large scale usage of the Ovshinsky diode was poor reliability. It would be very difficult to obtain F.A.A approval for using such an amorphous semiconductor device in the cockpit.</p>

<h1>Time-bandwidth product</h1>

<p>The time-bandwidth product of a pulse is the product of its temporal duration and spectral width (in Frequency space). In ultrafast Laser physics, it is common to specify the full width at half maximum (FWHM) both in time and frequency domain. The minimum possible time-bandwidth product is obtained for bandwidth-limited pulses. For example, it is ≈0.315 for bandwidth-limited sech2-shaped Pulses or ≈0.44 for Gaussian-shaped pulses. This means e.g. that for a given spectral width, there is a lower limit for the pulse duration. This limitation is essentially a property of the Fourier transform.</p>

<p>Here is the bandwidth specification and calculation I was hoping could 
be considered further if we can ignore the laser amplifier gain bandwidth product.</p>

<p>For a 1 microsecond laser pulse duration,</p>

<p>$$\text{bandwidth} = \frac{0.44}{1\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{s}} = 4.4 \times 10^7\ \mathrm{Hz}\ \text{FWHM}$$</p>

<p>so full width half maximum is 44 Megahertz (MHz).</p>

<p>So if we flipped the bottle so that the bottom of the bottle was facing up and the top of the bottle was facing down. If you open the bottle cap to try and remove the water, what would happen?</p>

<p>The aim is to know if the air in the bottle would expand (thus holding the bottles shape) or if the air would remain the same amount and just crunch the bottle; assuming that the water does come out. </p>

<p>My Assumption: I would think the water would not come out the bottle as the air is not able to expand.  If you forced the water out the bottle (ie squeeze it out) then I would think that it would scrunch up as to not expand but to continue to occupy the same amount of space for the whole time. (further example at the bottom) When you do this same experiment where there is no vacuum (try this at home) when you tip the water out, there are bubbles that come up and replace the space that the water was occupying</p>

<p>FURTHER EXAMPLE: if we had a bottle that can hold up to 100 units of anything. We have 70 units of water in it and 30 units of air. If you tip the bottle and then open the cap (where outside the bottle has air) you would see that when the water leaks, the bottle holds only 60 units of water, so there will be bubbles that go up into the bottle to occupy the spare 10 units in the bottle. 
The question is to see what would be replacing that 10 units in the bottle where there is a vacuum outside the bottle.</p>

"274018","Attraction between two wires with parallel current","<p>I'm self-studying electric and magnetic forces, and I'm stuck on one concept that I can't seem to resolve.</p>

<p>The book I'm using (College Physics Reasoning and Relationships, Giordano) explains a situation between two horizontal parallel wires.  If a parallel current is run to the right in each wire, there will be a magnetic field encircling each wire.  The top wire (in a diagram of the magnetic field) will have x's  below the wire and dots above, but so will the bottom wire.</p>

<p>The book explains that ignoring the magnetic field of the lower wire, the magnetic force on the lower wire will be aimed toward toward the above wire, and vice versa.  This makes sense to me if we ignore each magnetic field to see each magnetic force.</p>

<p>My confusion comes in that my initial reaction is that if the magnetic fields in between the two wires would be superimposed the result would be a zero magnetic field.  I think I thought of this because the book explains that potential and electric fields could use the principle of superposition to figure out the strength at each point.</p>

<p>The system works with two wheels spinning in opposite directions with different velocities. The ball goes through the middle and gets launched with some spin on it. The figure illustrates it. For simplicity, I am considering the launcher is placed horizontally aligned with the table.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cTPV8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cTPV8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I will now apologize for any mistakes from now on, because I am pretty bad in physics, but I try my best. </p>

<p>Here goes a step-by-step of what I think happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wheels spin at certain speed $V_1$ and $V_2$</li>
<li>The ball touches both wheels at the same time. The difference between the two forces applied on top and bottom of the ball will generate a spin</li>
<li>The ball gets horizontally launched (as it was rolling on a table and there is no more table to roll)</li>
</ol>

<p>Considering this is correct, I am having some trouble to write the equations. In (1), should I put in terms of velocity or force? So when the ball touches the wheels, two Forces are applied tangent to the ball in opposite directions. The difference of these forces generates a torque $\tau = r \times (F_1 - F_2)$. This torque starts a forward rolling movement with speed $V$. And from this speed, a horizontal launch.</p>

In Rindler coordinates, the hyperbolic motion of the observer is expressed through the coordinate transformation
$$t=a^{-1}e^{a{{\xi}}}\sinh a{\eta}\\
{}x=a^{-1}e^{a{{\xi}}}\cosh a{\eta}.$$
On a space-time diagram, the null light rays act as a horizon for the observer. This is because light sent from outside the observer's ""Rindler wedge"" can never catch up.</p>

<p>Now let's consider the wave equation. In regular Minkowski space, the equation reads</p>

<p>$$\square\,\varphi = \bigg(\frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial}t^2}-\frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial}x^2}\bigg)\,\varphi=0$$</p>

<p>with a general solution corresponding to plane waves $\varphi = e^{\pm ikx-i{\omega}t}$. In Rindler coordinates, the wave equation is</p>

<p>$$\square\,\varphi = e^{-2a \xi}\bigg(\frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial}\eta^2}-\frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial}\xi^2}\bigg)\,\varphi=0$$</p>

<p>Since this equation has the same form of that for Minkowski space, I would expect the solutions to be the same. However, in the notes, the solution depends on what region of space-time is being considered. Specifically, the given solution is (see eqs. (17), (18) )
$$^R\varphi =      
\begin{cases} 
      e^{ik\xi -i{\omega}{\eta}} &amp; \text{in }R \\
0 &amp; \text{in }L
   \end{cases}\\
^L\varphi =      
\begin{cases} 
      0 &amp; \text{in }R \\
e^{ik\xi +i{\omega}{\eta}} &amp; \text{in }L
   \end{cases}
$$
where $^R\varphi$ and $^L\varphi$ correspond to the solutions in $R$ and $L$, the right and left ""Rindler wedges"", respectively. The sum of these solutions is the general solution to the wave equation over the entire space-time.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Why does the solution need to be broken down into these $L$ and $R$ wedges? Since the wave equation is identical to that for regular Minkowski space, why wouldn't the solution be identical as well?</li>
<li>How are the signs ($\pm$) chosen for each wedge? For instance, why does the right wedge have $e^{ik\xi \textbf{-}i{\omega}{\eta}}$ while the left wedge has $e^{ik\xi \textbf{+}i{\omega}{\eta}}$?</li>

We know there are two characteristic features of superconductors, one is the perfect electrical conductivity; the other is the perfect diamagnetism. Since the composite fermions are neutral and effectively live in zero magnetic field, which is at least true at filling fraction 5/2 or 1/2, there can not be any true superconductivity. I know the perfect diamagnetism is translated to incompressibility for composite fermions so it explains why the pairing state is a qualified FQHE state. The question is: what does the perfect conductivity in a true superconductor correspond to in the composite fermion case? It is certainly not a perfect electrical conduction as composite fermions are neutral. </p>

There is a meter stick at rest in $S$ with left and right ends $L^\mu$ and $R^\mu$ respectively, which can be represented as spacetime points:</p>

<p>$L^\mu=(t,0,0,0)$</p>

<p>$R^\mu=(t,1,0,0)$.</p>

<p>With $c=1$, the Lorentz transformation from $S$ to $S^\prime$ in matrix form is</p>

<p>$
 \Lambda^{\mu^\prime}_{\;\;\mu}
 =
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \gamma &amp; -\gamma v &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
 \end{pmatrix}
 .
 $</p>

<p>Using this transformation on a general spacetime point in $S$, $x^\mu=(t,x,y,z)$, produces the coordinate relationships:</p>

<p>$t^\prime=\gamma t -\gamma v x$</p>

<p>$x^\prime=\gamma x -\gamma v t$.</p>

<p>Using these relationships, $L$ and $R$ can be written as points in $S^\prime$:</p>

<p>$L^{\mu^\prime}=(\gamma t -\gamma v x_L, \gamma x_L -\gamma v t, 0, 0)$</p>

<p>$R^{\mu^\prime}=(\gamma t -\gamma v x_R, \gamma x_R -\gamma v t, 0, 0)$.</p>

<p><em>(I believe my logical flaw is here)</em> If our goal is to measure the distance of the meter stick with respect to $S^\prime$, we need to find the difference in the $x^\prime$ components of $L^{\mu^\prime}$ and $R^{\mu^\prime}$ when their $t^\prime$ components are equal, so we equate their time components:</p>

<p>$\gamma t -\gamma v x_L = \gamma t -\gamma v x_R$.</p>

<p>With $x_L=0$ and $x_R=1$, we get</p>

<p>$0=\gamma v x_R$,</p>

<p>which is only true when $v=0$ (which it isn't) or $x_R=0$ (which it isn't).</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> What is the logical flaw in equating the time components of the left and right spacetime points of the meter stick in order to find their $x^\prime$ components at a synchronized time $t^\prime$ so that the meter stick's contracted length can be measured as $\Delta x^\prime=R^{x^\prime}-L^{x^\prime}$?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I want to clarify <em>why</em> I thought to equate their time components in the first place. My understanding is that the length of an object in a reference frame $F$ is the difference in their spatial coordinates when measured at the same time within that reference frame.</p>

Do these Markov processes have at least one of the following properties associated to them?</p>

<p>1) A stationary state/measure: a nonzero state which is invariant in time under the Markov process.</p>

<p>2) All measures approach (or even converge to) the zero measure on compact parts of the configuration space.</p>

<p>If we would drop mass-conservation, we could consider the configuration space $\mathbb{R}$ and $P:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}:$ multiplication by 2 as a counterexample.</p>

$P_{ij}=\delta_{i,j+1}$. This Markov process has no stationary state and since for any state $\mu$ we have $\mu(i,t)=\mu(i-t,0)$, neither do states converge uniformly to the zero state in $L^1$-norm (or any other translation-invariant norm).

"274145","Is this trick for finding the eq.s of motion of a rod being pushed up a incline valid?","<p>So I'm trying to find the equations of motion for the point $Q$ (as seen in the figure below) along an incline with angle $\beta$ with the horizontal, when the rod from $P$ to $Q$ is pushed by a constant and horizontal force $F$. Assume no friction. </p>

<p>I've calculated that the horizontal force, $F_s$, that must be applied at $P$ in order to keep the rod static at an angle $\alpha$ is 
$$F_s=\frac{\cos \alpha \sin \beta}{\cos \alpha \cos \beta +1}F_G$$
which has a maximum when $\alpha=0$ in the interval $[0,\beta]$. </p>

<p>The ""trick"" is now to say that we can calculate the eq.s of motion for $Q$ resulting from the constant $F$ on $P$ by calculating the eq.s of motion for $Q$ when the force (before $F$) is now the variable $F-F_s$. </p>

<p>For example, by choosing $F$ to be the minimum force required to set the rod in motion, $$F=F_s(\alpha=0)=\frac{\sin \beta}{\cos \beta +1}F_G,$$ 
we would obtain (where $x$ is along the incline)
$$m\ddot{x}=F-F_s=F_G\sin \beta \left( \frac{1}{\cos \beta-1} - \frac{\cos \alpha}{\cos \alpha \sin \beta +1}\right)$$
Now we express $\alpha$ by $x$ as 
$$\cos\alpha =\frac{x}{L}\left(\cos \beta -1 \right)+1$$
to obtain the rather nasty looking D.E.
$$\ddot{x}(t)=g\sin \beta \left[\frac{1}{\cos \beta-1} - \frac{1}{\sin \beta+\left(\frac{x(t)}{L}\left(\cos \beta -1 \right) \right)^{-1}} \right]$$</p>

  <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Is this method of ""pretending"" we apply a force which is the force ""left over"" from what is required to keep the rod static valid?

"274154","Quantized fields on Schwarzschild, QNM and bound states","<p>In the process of quantization of a scalar field (in massive as in massless cases) propagating on a Schwarzschild background, we are first of all required to solve the equations of motion. Typically, we work in the tortoise coordinate, pushing the event horizon to $r_* \rightarrow \infty$, avoiding the singularity $r = 0$ and allowing an hermitian propagating operator (I guess, as it is the singularity at $r = 0$ that makes it non-hermitian, see <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.16.937"" rel=""nofollow"">Sanchez 1977</a>), with respect to a standard inner product $\int_\Sigma \phi^* \psi$, $\Sigma$ being a Cauchy surface outside the horizon at $t = const$. Using the timelike Killing vector, we can find solutions of the form $e^{-i\omega t}f(r,\theta, \phi)$, and inserting this in the equations, we have in general to find the spectrum $\omega$ and the functions $f$. </p>

<p>We have now three types of solutions : </p>

<ul>
<li>$\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ : the standard asymptotic plane waves, that appear usually in the decomposition of the field (and depending on the positive frequency dependance, yield Boulware, Unruh and Hartle Hawking vacua) ;</li>
<li>$\omega \in \mathbb{C}$ and requiring waves entering inside the black hole and outgoing at infinity : quasinormal modes (non-normalizable) ;</li>
<li>$\omega \in \mathbb{C}$ and requiring waves entering inside the black hole and normalizable at infinity (in the massive case only) : bound states (that are actually quasibound, as they decay over time).</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess that we don't use quasinormal modes because they don't provide normalizable wavefunctions. But what if we used the bounded modes, summing thus also over their complex frequencies ? I thought that while quantizing we should have a complete basis for solutions of the equations of motion, whereas here, bound states are not included. </p>

<p>Could someone help me clarify that point ? </p>

If we construct the gaussian surface as shown (cylinder with one of the discs in the negatively charged plate of the capacitor) and the field at P is to be calculated, then as the total charge within the surface is zero so total flux will be zero. And the electric field is at all points normal to the plane of the plates of the infinitely long capacitor and also the discs of the cylinder, so the electric field at P must be zero, but P is closer to the positively charged plate and thus an outward electric field must be present at P.

<p>Is $ \Phi_{E} = \oint \vec{E} \bullet d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_{0}} \ \ $ still valid for non-uniform electric fields enclosed within Gaussian Surfaces?</p>

"274181","Charge above grounded plane","<p>To find the electric field discontinuity $$\vec{E}_{above} - \vec{E}_{below } = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\hat{n} \implies \frac{\partial V_{above}}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial V_{below}}{\partial n} = -\frac{\sigma}{ \epsilon_0}$$ across a boundary, we follow the approach as outlined in <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/24709/the-discontinuity-of-electric-field"">this post</a>. In the derivation we took a very small and thin gaussian surface. Hence $\sigma$ is the surface charge corresponding to that patch of charged surface. For a conductor then, the field immediately outside is $$\vec{E} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\hat{n}$$ where $\sigma$ is still a surface charge of a patch. </p>

<p>Given a problem where we have a point charge $q$ held a distance $d$ above an infinite grounded conducting plane $(V = 0)$. The charge $q$ induces a certain amount of negative charge on the nearby surface of the conductor. We find the potential above the conductor to be $V(x,y,z)$. Then using the formula above, we have $$\sigma = -\epsilon_0\frac{\partial V_{above}}{\partial n}$$ since we have $V_{below} = 0$ and hence $\frac{\partial V_{below}}{\partial n} =0$. We eventually get $$\sigma(x,y) = \frac{-qd}{2 \pi (x^2 + y^2 + d^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}.$$</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Would the potential $V_{below}$ still necessarily be zero inside the conductor even after inducing a charge on the surface of the conductor? Is the surface charge $\sigma(x,y)$ interpreted as the surface charge of a small patch around every point $(x,y)$?  </p>

"274193","Work required to bring particle towards grounded plane","<p>I have a quick question: </p>

<p>If you suspend a charge $q$ above a grounded conducting plane a distance $z$ above the plane, you get that the charge induces a negative surface charge on the conductor. The force of attraction on the particle is hence $$\vec{F} = - \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q^2}{(2d)^2}\hat{z}.$$ Hence to find the energy of this system when the particle is a distance $d$ above the plane, we can consider the work required to bring the charge in from infinity. The force required to oppose the electrical force above is $$\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q^2}{(2d)^2}\hat{z}$$ so $$W = \int^{d}_{\infty}F \cdot dI = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\int^{d}_{\infty}\frac{q^2}{4z^2}dz = -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q^2}{4d}.$$<br>
Am I correct in interpreting the fact that the work is negative as a result that the particle is attracted to the plane as we bring it in and it induces surface charge on the surface of the conductor, hence the particle is naturally pulled towards the plane requiring in a sense, no external work but rather aided by the attraction force?</p>

"274197","Constraints in classical mechanics","<p>I am self-studying classical mechanics and I have a couple of questions about constraints. Goldstein in his book ""Classical Mechanics"" writes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is an overly simplified view to think that all problems in mechanics are reduced to solving the set of differential equations:
  $$m_i r_i^{''}(t) = F_i^{(e)} + \Sigma F_{ij} \tag{$\dagger$}$$ where $F_i^{(e)}$ denotes the net external force on particle $i$ and $F_{ij}$ denotes the force exerted by particle $j$ on $i$ because one may need to take into account the necessary constraints for the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, he says that the constraints introduce two types of difficulties in solving mechanical problems: (i) $r_i$ are no longer independent and (ii) constraint forces are not known in general.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>IF</strong> it is possible to identify <em>all</em> the constraint forces, then all the problems would be reduced to solving $(\dagger)$, where $F_i^{(e)}$ includes all the constraints forces. Wouldn't it? If not, is there a constraint that cannot be translated into a corresponding constraint force? </p>

<p>(2) Isn't (ii) in fact the only difficulty with solving mechanical problems? It seems to me that (i) is not a ""difficulty"" because provided we can identify all the constraint forces the fact that $r_i$ are not independent would be incorporated into the constraint forces that would appear in the equations of motion. Isn't the fact that $r_i$ are not independent nothin but that the equations of motion are coupled ODEs? </p>

<p>My first thought was to get h, which is relatively easy but i had a problem choosing between 2 methods: first one was to assume it was a lumped system (the sphere) and use the exp(Bi*F) rule where the h will be the only unknown, or I can use the Heisler Charts where I have the temperature ratio and the Fourier number and I can use them to get the 1/Bi.</p>

<p>In both cases the h will result in a lumped system in the cylinder, but the final temperatures in each case is different ( 5 degrees different), so it's pretty obvious that one of them is true.</p>

Consider a band diagram.  PN junction, heterostructure, whatever it might be. It's a very useful tool to determine where there is field, where there is space charge by slopes, band bending etc.  </p>

<p>However, as I recall, the strictest definition is that this is the potential an electron sees due to the hybridization of the atomic lattice states.  Any charges, i.e. defect/traps, surfaces, polarization charges, etc. are all fixed.  Does this mean that mobile charge cannot contribute to the band diagram in the strictest definition?</p>

<p>For instance, the Kirk effect in HBT/BJTs essentially ""undoes"" some of the reverse bias band bending when a large electron current is passing through such that there is a condition J less than qns for the band diagram to be plausible.  OR what about strongly correlated systems, like perovskites, where alot of the physics is due to electron electron interactions, which is NOT including in BDs? Alot of work goes into Mott-Hubbard transistions, which if I recall correctly cannot be inferred from BDs.  </p>

<p>So are band diagrams technically only the potential seen in a fictional ""1 electron"" system, which is a valid approximation assuming an electron gas?  Or could one in principle, create BD's which do involve mobile carrier potential (Assuming one could solve those difficult Hamiltonians!)</p>

I started by taking the Hermitian adjoint of all components of the original Dirac equation, giving me
$$\psi^{\dagger}(-i\gamma^{\mu\dagger}\partial_{\mu}^{\dagger}-m)=0.\tag{2}$$ The adjoint of the gamma matrices is defined to be $\gamma^{\mu\dagger}=\gamma^0\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^0$, so no issues there. Now intuitively, I would think that the adjoint of the 4-gradient would be $\partial_{\mu}^{\dagger}=-\partial_{\mu}$. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, it can be shown that first derivative operators are anti-Hermitian, so for example, $\frac{d}{dx}^{\dagger}=-\frac{d}{dx}$. So I would think this would the same case for the 4-gradient, but apparently it isn't. Among the many derivations I've gone over, for example, on page 77 <a href=""http://www.desy.de/~martillu/QFT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, it claims that the 4-gradient is self-adjoint.

"274306","Thermal non-equilibrium during reheating of the early universe","<p>I've recently been trying to learn a bit about the process of reheating the universe post inflation. In particular, I have come across the notion of ""<em>preheating</em>"" in which the inflaton field, $\phi$ is treated classically in terms of a time-dependent background and (bosonic) $\chi$-particles are produced via parametric resonance of the associated (bosonic) quantum field, $\hat{\chi}$. From what I understand so far, the $\chi$-particles are produced explosively within certain ""bands"" of momentum (so-called ""<em>instability bands</em>""), occurring as $\phi$ passes through the minimum of its potential, $V(\phi)$. </p>

<p>What I'm unsure about is why the $\chi$-particles produced during this process start out in thermal non-equilibrium with one another? </p>

<p>Is it simply because the particles are produced within these bands of momentum and so the initial distribution of momenta within the system of produced $\chi$-particles is not Gaussian, and hence does not form an equilibrium distribution. Then, over some period of time, the system of $\chi$-particles attains thermal equilibrium through collisions between the $\chi$-particles, in which the momentum is redistributed such that the occupation numbers of $\chi$-particles among the available momentum states of the system tends towards a ""Boltzmann-like"" distribution and reaches thermal equilibrium?!</p>

"
"274313","Correlation functions in thermal non-equilibrium","<p>As I understand it, in thermal non-equilibrium it is possible for there to be non-trivial correlations between particle and anti-particle states. In particular, I have been reading up on the theory of ""<em>preheating</em>"" in the early universe, in which one considers the production of bosonic particles due to interactions between a real scalar field $\hat{\chi}$ and the inflaton field, $\phi$. The elementary analysis involves treating the inflaton field classically as a time dependent background field, $\phi(t)$, and then considering the $\hat{\chi}$ field in the presence of this time-dependent background, in terms of its Fourier modes, as $$\hat{\chi}(t,\mathbf{x})=\int\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\pi)^{3}\sqrt{2\omega_{\mathbf{k}}(t)}}\left(\hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}+\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}} \right)$$ where $\omega_{\mathbf{k}}(t)$ is the instantaneous oscillation frequency of the Fourier modes of $\hat{\chi}$ (the explicit time dependence is due to the influence of the time dependent background on the effective mass of the field), and $ \hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)$, $\hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)$ are the creation and annihilation operators of the field, respectively.</p>

<p>Given this, it is possible to have non-zero correlation functions for particle and anti-particle states, i.e. $$\langle \hat{a}^{\dagger}_{-\mathbf{k}}(t)\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)\rangle:=\text{tr}\left(\hat{\rho}(t) \hat{a}^{\dagger}_{-\mathbf{k}}(t) \hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)\right)\\ \langle \hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)\hat{a}_{-\mathbf{k}}(t)\rangle:=\text{tr}\left(\hat{\rho}(t) \hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}}(t) \hat{a}_{-\mathbf{k}}(t)\right)$$ where $ \hat{\rho}(t) $ is the density operator describing the state of the system at each given instant in time, $t$.</p>

<p>My question is, why are these correlation functions non-zero in thermal non-equilibrium, but are zero once the system attains thermal equilibrium?</p>

<p>Is it simply because that, due to the time dependent background in which the field is embedded, the annihilation and creation operators of the field do not evolve independently of one another, but instead their equations of motion are coupled to one another, such that they ""rotate"" into one another as they evolve, i.e. $$ \dot{\hat{a}}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)=i\left[\hat{H}(t),  \hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)\right] +\frac{\dot{\omega}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)}{2\omega_{\mathbf{k}}(t)}  \hat{a}^{\dagger}_{-\mathbf{k}}(t)\\ \dot{\hat{a}}^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)=i\left[\hat{H}(t),  \hat{a}^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)\right] +\frac{\dot{\omega}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)}{2\omega_{\mathbf{k}}(t)}  \hat{a}_{-\mathbf{k}}(t)$$ (where $\hat{H}(t)$ is the Hamiltonian the theory) whereas, once the system of $\chi$-particles attain thermal equilibrium, the inflaton field will have exponentially decayed such that $ \dot{\omega}_{\mathbf{k}}(t)\rightarrow 0$, and as such the creation and annihilation operators will evolve independently of one another and therefore there week no longer be any correlation between them. Would this be correct at all, or are there other reasons why such correlation functions are non-zero outside thermal equilibrium, but vanish once the system has attained thermal equilibrium?!</p>

"274318","Is there a ""more rigorous"" derivation of the electrostatic boundary conditions?","<p>When I first saw a derivation of the electrostatic boundary conditions it wasn't quite rigorous. It was essentially the argument used by Griffiths in his book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we draw a wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox, extending just barely over the edge in each direction. Gauss' law states that:</p>
  
  <p>$$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{ a} = \dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}Q_{\text{enc}}=\dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sigma A,$$</p>
  
  <p>where $A$ is the area of the pillbox lid. (If $\sigma$ varies from point to point or the surface is curved, we must pick $A$ to be extremly small.) Now, the <em>sides</em> of the pillbox contribute nothing to the flux, in the limit as the thickness $\epsilon$ goes to zero, so we are left with:</p>
  
  <p>$$E^\perp_{\text{above}}-E^\perp_{\text{below}}=\dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sigma,$$</p>
  
  <p>where $E^\perp_{\text{above}}$ denotes the component of $\mathbf{E}$ that is perpendicular to the surface immediately above, and $E^\perp_{\text{below}}$ is the same, only just below the surface. For consistency, we let ""upward"" be the positive direction for both. <em>Conclusion: The normal component of $\mathbf{E}$ is discontinuous by an amount $\sigma/\epsilon_0$ at any boundary.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One analogous argument is also used for the continuity of the tangential component.</p>

<p>Now, on the one hand this argument is intuitive and easy to follow. It allows one to have one intuition on what is going on. On the other hand, I find it a quite ""hand waving"" argument.</p>

<p>Is there a more rigorous, less hand waving way to derive the boundary conditions: both for the normal and tangential components?</p>

I do not doubt <a href=""http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_16-5-2014-15-32-44"">this process</a>. However I'm less confident about the Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics"">two-photon physics article</a>. It talks about gamma-gamma pair production, and as far as I know it's in line with what some particle physicists say. It says this:</p>

<p><em>""From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics"">quantum electrodynamics</a> it can be found that photons cannot couple directly to each other, since they carry no charge, but they can interact through higher-order processes<sup>[clarification needed]</sup>. A photon can, within the bounds of the uncertainty principle, fluctuate into a charged fermion–antifermion pair, to either of which the other photon can couple"".</em></p>

<p>However as far as I know, a 511keV photon does not spend its life magically morphing into a 511keV electron and a 511keV positron. That’s in breach of conservation of energy. In similar vein the electron and the positron cannot then magically morph back into a single 511keV photon. That's in breach of conservation of momentum. Moreover photons travel at the speed of light whilst electrons and positrons do not - a photon cannot spend its life fluctuating into fermion pairs, if it did it couldn't travel at c. Besides, virtual particles are <em>virtual</em>. As in not real. They aren't short-lived real particles that pop in and out of existence like magic. Instead <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/185139/76162"">they only exist in the mathematics of the model</a>. Which is why hydrogen atoms don’t twinkle, and magnets don’t shine. On top of all that pair production surely does not occur because pair production occurred. Spontaneously. Like worms from mud. All in all, this explanation for pair production is woefully inadequate. A better explanation is required. So:</p>

<p><strong>How does gamma-gamma pair production really work?</strong>   </p>

"274333","Would a black hole evaporate before reaching the event horizon?","<p>Consider Alice approaching a black hole while Bob observes her journey from a distance. Due to the large gravitational field surrounding the black hole, Bob observes Alice her clock to slow down as she approaches the event horizon. Alice, on the other hand, sees Bob's clock speeding up as she approaches the horizon.</p>

<p>Once Alice reaches the horizon, her clock stops according to Bob's observation, while she notices no change of rate on her clock (proper time). On the other hand, when she looks at Bob, she observes time progressing at an incredibly high rate on his clock.</p>

<p>Now, in a heat death scenario for our universe, the black hole is bound to evaporate by Hawking radiation eventually. From Alice her perspective, 'eventually' might be very soon on her world line. I would therefore hypothesize that she will witness the evaporation just as she remains about to cross the event horizon. I would imagine the black hole to shrink before her very eyes; leaving Alice in a distant future where the black hole has evaporated.</p>

<p>By that time however, Alice would have been bombarded with a large, and probably lethal, dose of Hawking radiation. Is my analysis of the situation correct? If so, why are we told a different story by physicists? If not, where is the error in my reasoning? For instance, could it be that Alice does not observe time to progress infinitely fast in the rest of the universe, if she were to cross the event horizon?</p>

<p>Now, the actual question starts:</p>

<p>Consider a mass <strong>m</strong>  which just starts moving towards a fixed mass <strong>M</strong> due to gravitational attraction. Let initial distance between <strong>m</strong> and <strong>M</strong> be <strong>r</strong>. After time <strong>t</strong>, let distance between them be <strong>r′</strong>. Now consider a small instant <strong>dt</strong>.In this instant of time, let the moving mass move through a distance <strong>dr′</strong>. Let velocity of moving mass be <strong>v</strong>. Thus, new mass of moving mass is <strong>m′= mγ</strong>.

<pre><code>As per equation (3),
     dm′/dr′ = F/c²
     where F is GMm′/(r′)²
   ⇒ dm′/dr′ = GMm′/(r′c)²
   ⇒ (dm′)/m′ = (GM/c²)(dr′/r′²)
   Integrating, we get
       ln(m′/m) = (GM/c²)((1/r′)-(1/r))
                      = GM(r-r′)/rr′c² = f(r′)  [say f(x) = GM(r-x)/xrc²]
      ⇒ m’ = m(e^-f(r))
   Is this true? Or have I done mistake anywhere?

"274367","Are there any models of planetary formation that aren't full of arbitrary fine tuned parameters?","<p>I noticed that this was very common in planet formation theories. I would be interested in counterexamples. </p>

<p>Example of finely tuned models:</p>

<p>There are four stages in the supposed evolution of planets, according to the reference:</p>

<p>‘A successful nebular model must account in some detail for four important stages in the solar system’s evolution: the formation of the nebula out of which the planets and sun originate, the formation of the original planetary bodies, the subsequent evolution of the planets, and the dissipation of leftover gas and dust. Modern nebular models (there are more than one!) give tentative explanations for these stages, but many details are lacking. No one model today is entirely satisfactory.’</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, I will just assume that the dust is leftover from a supernova explosion. This is the first stage. Then according to Laplace’s nebular hypothesis, first presented in 1796, the process of planet formation, the second stage, begins with the simple collapse of the dust cloud. There are three theoretical steps in the collapse of the dust cloud and the growth of a planet: 1) gravitational contraction of the dust into small particles, 2) accretion of particles or small aggregates to form large aggregates, and 3) condensation by the accumulation of atoms and molecules on the growing mass.</p>

<p>The most difficult step is the first, gravitational contraction of dust to form small particles. Dust grains must first accrete to form small particles, which must continue to grow until they are at least 10 m in diameter. This size is the point at which gravity is expected to come into its own, accreting and condensing material at a faster and faster rate. Then supposedly, planetesimals would form that are many kilometres across. The planetesimals are finally envisaged to collide to form planets. There are difficult problems with these later steps, but I will focus on the first step: how does the dust collide, stick together and grow before gravity can assert itself? That is the big question. The tiny dust particles must hit each other head on and stick. The process (which is speculative anyhow) is too slow, especially in cold regions of space, according to astronomers. A number of hypotheses are in vogue, but all seem to have fatal flaws.</p>

<p>Steinn Sigurdsson has given up on all the proposed hypotheses because of the extreme unlikelihood that any of them ever occurred. Since planets have obviously formed and they must hold onto their evolutionary belief, he suggests a desperate alternative:</p>

<p>‘ … there could be an extra dimension of space in which gravity alone acts and which until now has gone unnoticed. If this is so, then gravity—which is weak over large distances—gets stronger at the tiny distances encompassed by the extra dimension … .’</p>

<p>In other words, he suggests that gravity would extend into five space dimensions instead of three and would be very strong at very short distances, causing dust and small particles to attract and stick together by gravitational attraction. This would certainly make planet formation much faster and easier. But there is at least one delicate problem with this imaginative hypothesis—the dust grains cannot hit too hard or the incipient particle would break apart:</p>

<p>‘So the turbulence within the disc [flat dust cloud] can’t be too strong, and the acceleration caused by Sigurdsson’s modified gravity can’t be too extreme.’ </p>

<p>The idea is actually testable. So far, Newton’s law of gravity still holds down to 218 μm, but experiments are underway to test it at even closer distances. Sigurdsson hopes that his supergravity mechanism will show up when they test gravity at less than 80 μm. It seems to me that if he is correct, there is still the ‘sticky’ problem of how such a small particle can grow larger than 218 μm, above which his hypothetical mechanism would not apply.</p>

<p>Astrophysics makes the absurd ssumption that gravity dominates at small scales.</p>

"274377","Boundary conditions for Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL)","<p>The Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) is a semiconductor device for the generation of radiation in the MIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. One period of the device consists of two regions, the active region and the collector region and a typical device might consist of approximately 20-75 periods. A region may consist of several wells, with typical well depths $\approx 500$ meV and well widths $\approx 10$ nm.</p>

<p>In the simplest approach all that is modelled is the central region of  the structure, where the laser action takes place and the first step is to solve the 1D Schrodinger equation for three periods to determine the wave functions and the eigenvalues associated with each region of the device (namely the injector, active and the collector regions, where the injector region is identical to the collector region and the term comes from how the device is used: electrons are injected from the injector region to the active region where laser action takes place and then collected in the collector region .....).</p>

<p>To solve the Schrodinger equation the following approach is often taken (for example see R. M. Kolbas and N. Holonyak Jr.  Am. J. Phys. <strong>52</strong>, 431 (1984), Paul Harrison Quantum Wells, Wires and Dots): The three period section is extended by some arbitrary amount and for some chosen value of the energy and some step size, $\delta z$, the wave function is numerically iterated from $z = 0$ to the extreme of the (extended) three period structure, $z = z_f$, with the following boundary condition applied: $\psi(0) = 0, \psi(\delta z) = 1$ (equivalent to fixing the wave function and its slope at the origin).</p>

<p>The energy is then changed until the boundary condition $\psi(z_f) = 0$ is satisfied.</p>

<p>However, for a (strictly) periodic lattice (of period a and length $L = Na$ where $N$ is a large integer), the wave function satisfies Bloch's Theorem, and you can label the wave function by an index $n$ such that the wave function in any one period must satisfy</p>

<p>$$\psi(x+a) = e^{iKa}\psi(x), K = (2 \pi n)/(N a), n = 0,\pm 1, \pm 2, ....$$</p>

<p>The question is, when you solve for the wave function you only seem to assume $n=0$. What about all the other states?</p>

  <p>Unlike a sea wave, whose motion is only apparent, a moving vortex ring actually carries the spinning fluid along. Just as a rotating wheel lessens the friction between the core and the surrounding stationary fluid, allowing it to travel a long distance with relatively little loss of mass and kinetic energy, and little change in size or shape. Thus, a vortex ring can carry mass much further and with less dispersion than a jet of fluid.</p>

<p>It is explained that if a photon is introduced between the beam splitter and either of the mirrors, it will be detected at one of the two detectors at random. However, if it is introduced before the beam splitter, it will always appear at the same detector. From this follows that the (unobservable) split histories of the photon influence where it will be
detected, so an explanation like splitting and interference of universes is necessary.</p>

$$\int \theta(x) \phi'(x)dx = -\int \theta'(x) \phi(x)dx  \, .\tag{3}$$

<p>Here $\omega$ is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_production"" rel=""nofollow"">entropy production</a> of the system over some finite time interval. $P_F(\omega)$ gives the probability distribution of this entropy production (because the system is stochastic $\omega$ will be different for each run). $P_R(-\omega)$ gives the distribution for the time-reversed process. What this typically means is that the control parameter $\lambda_F(\tau)$ for the driving force is run in reversed order, $\lambda_R(\tau) = \lambda_F(t-\tau)$, where $t$ is the length of the time interval.</p>

<p>This theorem is derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, and this is stated in the form</p>

<p>$\frac{\mathcal{P}[x(+t)|\lambda(+t)]}{\mathcal{P}[\bar{x}(-t)|\bar{\lambda}(-t)]} = \exp{(-\beta Q[x(+t)|\lambda(+t)])}$,</p>

<p>where $\mathcal{P}[x(+t)|\lambda(+t)]$ is the likelihood of seeing the microscopic trajectory $x(+t)$ (corresponding to e.g. positions and momenta of particles) if we apply the control parameter $\lambda(t)$, and the bar indicates the time-reversed processes. $Q$ is the heat produced in the process.</p>

<p>Now consider a process where the control parameter is not varied over time, i.e. $\lambda(\tau) = \lambda$. There seems to be no reason why the theorem should no longer hold. But then there should also be no heat transfer, $Q=0$ and no work done on the system. That would imply that the forward and reverse processes are equally likely.
However, consider for instance the mixing of a gas, where initially two different types of particles are separated by a barrier at $t=0$. The barrier is released and the gas molecules are free to move in the whole container. The entropy of the system increases, and the process is clearly irreversible. Yet the Crooks Fluctuation Theorem would still predict equal probabilities of finding the forward and reverse processes. </p>

<p>I understand that the centre of mass of the bar will accelerate upwards at F/M, and there will also be an angular acceleration of the bar about its centre of mass, equal to FL/2 divided by I, so there will be two simultaneous motions of the bar.</p>

<p>However, if I were to apply the same force at the centre of mass of the horizontal bar, there would only be pure translation with the same upward acceleration of F/M, and no rotation.</p>

<p>However in both cases the same force F is applied, yet one clearly increases the translational and rotational kinetic energies of the bar, while the other only increases its translational kinetic energy.</p>

<p>I can't seem to reconcile this difference. Where did I go wrong in my understanding of this concept?</p>

"274442","Relativity of simultaneity","<p>I was attempting explain to a co-worker my novice understanding of relativity, I'm was explaining  how speed/time/events/etc is relative. 
My question was could this also lead to a paradoxical/multi-universal(excluding string theory) when two events separated by space are linked? </p>

<p>For example:<br>
I thought about a scenario with which there are two bombs, only 1 bomb could explode (through whatever hypothetical means). A timer is set on both bombs for 10 seconds and 1 person picks up each bomb. Person A stands still, person B travels close to the speed of light close to the speed of light (person A and B can observe each other). 
Person A, observing person B sees that person B's countdown is going slower (since person B is traveling faster), thus persons A's observes his own bomb going off first which leads to person B's bomb being disengaged (Person B lives).</p>

<p>Person B however, is observing everything else(including person A) moving close to the speed of light in a circle around him (since speed is relative to the observer), thus he observes person A's timer going slower and thus his own explodes first and disengages person A's bomb (Person A lives).</p>

<p>From each perspective, the observer dies and the other lives, which seems to create two conflicting realities, so who actually lives and dies. I feel as though I am misunderstanding something here or am I correct?</p>

Please think a simple shake flashlight. It contains a Faraday's generator inside as all you know. More simply, it is comprised of a coil and a cylinder shaped neodymium magnet inside of it. When it is shaked on N-S trajectory, it converts kinetic energy to electric energy. But if you shake it on other directions, it won't continue to harvest electricity.
What I wonder actually, would it be possible to place our generator in some mechanism like gimbal/stabilizer/gyroscope/.. or something else; and make it produce maximum/optimum electricity?

"274480","Time for wave function to 'leak' through delta-function potential barrier; complex energy","<p>I'm tackling the current problem - Consider the potential:</p>

<p>$$
V(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\infty &amp; \text{if x $\leq 0$}\\
\alpha\delta(x-a) &amp; \text{if x $&gt;$ 0}\\
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>The particle starts out in the well ($0 &lt; x &lt; a$) but gradually 'leaks' through the delta function barrier over time due to tunnelling. The problem first asks to solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation and determine an expression for the energy $E$ (which it suggests is a complex number for this problem. This problem seems to be just yet another simple 1D 'solve the system' type problem, however there is an unusual twist in the last part of the question which I am currently not able to solve (please read on). Defining:</p>

<p>$$k\equiv\frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}$$</p>

<p>I have determined the solution to the TISE to be:</p>

<p>$$
\psi(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0 &amp; \text{if x $\leq 0$}\\
C\frac{e^{ika}sin(kx)}{sin(ka)} &amp; \text{if 0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ a}\\
Ce^{ikx} &amp; \text{if  x $\geq$ a}\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>Where $C$ is some constant to be determined by 'normalisation' (although the presence of the plane wave to the right of x = a renders this task hopeless, which, as you'll see, is part of my problem later on). In my solution to the TISE above I have set the coefficient of $e^{-ikx}$ to zero for $x &gt; a$, which represents no incident plane waves from the right. By using the standard approach to solving delta function systems (integrating the TISE around the delta function), I obtained for the energy:</p>

<p>$$E = \frac{\alpha^2}{\hbar^2{(i - cot(ka))^2}}$$</p>

<p>Which one can easily obtain by using my expression for $\psi(x)$ from above and integrating around the delta function. Encouragingly, E is indeed a complex number as the question suggested it would be. Note that the expression is implicit because $E$ also appears nested in the RHS inside of k; the question does not ask for an explicit rearrangement for $E$ (just to show that it is complex).</p>

<p>Now, the final part of the question is what confuses me. I am asked to 'calculate the time in terms of $\Gamma$' taken for the wave function to 'leak' through the potential barrier (i.e calculate the time for the probability in the region $0 \leq x \leq a$ to reach $1/e$. It is suggested to write the energy in the form:</p>

<p>$$E \equiv E_0 + i\Gamma$$</p>

<p>And then one obtains the full time-dependent solution by tacking this onto the (time-independent) expression for $\psi(x)$ I obtained above. However, I would have thought that the concept of the particle being found in a certain range is non-sensical in this problem, as the wave function is not normalisable. With such 'scattering-like' wave functions we can obtain transmission and reflection coefficients, but these are not what I'm looking for. Furthermore, the complex form of the energy given above ensures that the amplitude of $\psi(x)$ actually increases with time (if $\Gamma &gt; 0$) - although this is of course the well known argument for E being real in the first place, which the question admits is not the case here (so I assume one can still answer the question even with this issue).</p>

<p>So yes, to summarise, my issue is that I cannot figure out how to explicitly work out the time taken for the probability in the region $0 \leq x \leq a$ to reduce to $1/e$ the rest of the question is fine (IMO). I have noticed that the <em>first half</em> of this question (actually obtaining the value for E) has already been asked on SE, but it is not this part of the question that I have issue with. The latter half has not before been asked.</p>

"274492","Matrix diagonalization in SU(2) and SO(3)","<p>I'm currently using Nadri Jeevanjee's book on group theory for physicists to understand quantum mechanics. I came across <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FUMfA.png"">these two pages</a> that left me stuck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example 4.19</strong> $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$</p>
  
  <p>In most physics textbooks the relationship between $SO(3)$ and $SU(2)$ is described in terms of the 'infinitesimal generators' of these groups. We will discuss infinitesimal transformations in the next section and make contact with the standard physics presentation then; here we present the relationship in terms of a group homomorphism $\rho:SU(2)\to SO(3)$, defined as follows: consider the vector space (check!) of all $2\times2$ traceless anti-Hermitian matrices, denoted as $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ (for reasons we will explain later). You can check that an arbitrary element $X\in\mathfrak{su}(2)$ can be written as
  $$
X=\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} -iz &amp; -y -ix \\ y-ix &amp; iz \end{pmatrix},\quad x,y,z\in\mathbb R\tag{4.39}
$$
  If we take as basis vectors
  \begin{align}
S_x&amp;=-\frac i2\sigma_x=\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i \\ -i &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
S_y&amp;=-\frac i2\sigma_y=\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
S_z&amp;=-\frac i2\sigma_z=\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} -i &amp; 0  \\ 0 &amp; i\end{pmatrix} \\
\end{align}
  then we have
  $$X=xS_x + y S_y + z S_z$$
  so the column vector corresponding to $X$ in the basis $\mathcal B = \{ S_x, S_y, S_z\}$ is
  $$[X] = \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\\ z\end{pmatrix}.$$</p>
  
  <p>Note that 
  $$\det X = \frac14\left(x^2+y^2+z^2\right)=\frac14\|X\|^2$$
  so the determinant of $X\in\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is proportional to the norm squared of $[X]\in\mathbb R^3$ with the usual Euclidean metric. Now you will check below that $A\in SU(2)$ acts on $X\in\mathfrak{su}(2)$ by the map $X\mapsto AXA^\dagger$, and that this map is linear. Thus, this map is a linear operator on $\mathfrak{su}(2)$, and can be represented in the basis $\mathcal B$ by a $3\times 3$ matrix which we will call $\rho(A)$, so that $[AXA^\dagger]=\rho(A)[X]$ where $\rho(A)$ acts on $[X]$ by the usual matrix multiplication. Furthermore,
  $$\left\|\rho(A)[X]\right\| = \left\|[AXA^\dagger]\right\|^2 = 4 \det(AXA^\dagger) = 4 \det X = \left\|[X]\right\|^2 \tag{4.40}$$
  so that $\rho(A)$ preserves the norm of $X$. This implies (see Exercise 4.19 below) that $\rho(A)\in O(3)$, and one can in fact show<sup>13</sup> that $\det \rho(A) = 1$, so that $\rho(A)\in SO(3)$. Thus we may construct a map
  \begin{align}
\rho: SU(2) &amp; \to SO(3) \\ A &amp; \mapsto \rho(A)
\end{align}</p>
  
  <p>Furthermore, $\rho$ is a homomorphism, since
  \begin{align}
\rho(AB)[X] &amp; = \left[(AB)X(AB)^\dagger\right] = \left[AB X B^\dagger A^\dagger\right] =\rho(A) \left[BXB^\dagger\right]
\\ &amp; = \rho(A)\rho(B)[X] \tag{4.41}
\end{align}
  and hence $\rho(AB) = \rho(A)\rho(B)$. Is $\rho$ an isomorphism? One can show<sup>14</sup> that $\rho$ is onto but not one-to-one, and in fact has kernel $K=\{I,-I\}$. From the discussion preceding this example, we then know that $\rho(A)=\rho(-A)\ \forall A\in SU(2)$ (this fact is also clear from the definition of $\rho$), so for every rotation $R\in SO(3)$ there correspond exactly two matrices in $SU(2)$ which map to $R$ under $\rho$. Thus, when trying to implement a rotation $R$ on a spin $1/2$ particle we have two choices for the $SU(2)$ matrix we use, and it is sometimes said that the map $\rho^{-1}$ is <em>double-valued</em>. In mathematical terms one does not usually speak of functions with multiple-values, though, so instead we say that $SU(2)$ is the <strong><em>double cover</em></strong> of $SO(3)$, since the map $\rho$ is onto ('cover') and two-to-one ('double').</p>

"274502","Does surface tension of a liquid depend on the gas phase?","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Surface tension is apparent at liquid-gas interfaces, resulting from intermolecular forces. This would imply that it matters which molecules constitute the liquid and the gas phase. However, when I look at tabulated date for surface tension, often only the liquid component is mentioned.</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>Does the strength of surface tension depend significantly on the constituents of the gas phase? Is there a large difference between the surface tension of e.g. the liquid-air interface versus the liquid-vapor interface?</p>

<h2>Bonus question</h2>

<p>If it matters what the gas phase consists of, is there a silent convention when quoting values in tables? </p>

"274505","Do many-body systems fall apart eventually?","<p>Imagine an N-body problem with lots of particles of identical mass (billions of them).</p>

<p>I saw several simulations on the Internet, where the particles first form small clumps, then bigger clumps, then finally one huge globular cluster like clump around the center of mass.</p>

<p>Is this clump a stable feature? If we keep running the simulation forever, will this cluster stabilize and remain there forever, or will the particles gradually leak away so that the cluster dissolves?</p>

<p><em>Clarifications:</em> </p>

<p>The particles attract each other gravitationally (so if the distance is $r$ between two particles, the attractive force between them is proportional $1/r^2$).</p>

<p>Initial conditions are unconstrained, and indeed if the particles are too fast then it can't be bound gravitationally. So probably it's a function of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy in system, but what function?</p>

"274530","Do wormholes really exist?","<p>I have studied special relativity and have preliminary knowledge about general relativity. I came upon this thought which questions the existence of wormholes.</p>

<p>Wormholes are connections of different points in space-time which occur due to bending of the space time geometry. Like a piece of paper can be folded and a hole can be created to connect two points on the paper, which causes the distance between those two points to reduce to zero by creating a pathway directly from one point to another point. There are no experimental evidences to prove the existence of wormholes, however there are some theoretical solutions for wormholes.</p>

<p>I will describe a thought experiment which questions the existence of wormholes. I haven’t yet found out the flaw in the thought experiment or proper explanation other than that wormholes can’t exist. It would be great if I can get suggestions regarding the matter. </p>

<p><strong>The idea goes thus:</strong></p>

<p>Suppose two twins Howard and Raj are at the same point A in space-time. One day Howard gets the chance to travel in space (Basically the same setup as in the twin paradox). Howard boards a spaceship and starts moving away from point A in a straight line at a speed comparable to the speed of light. When he reaches point B in his journey (still travelling) the statements recorded by both of them are:</p>

<p>Raj: Howard has reached point B and time on my clock is 5 hours and time on Howard’s clock must be 3 hours (assume that Howard is moving with velocity corresponding to the above time intervals). So he is younger than me.
Howard: Raj is moving away from me and hence he is younger than me.
Howard is still moving at constant speed and hence both the frames are inertial. This is a paradoxical situation that who is correct and who is wrong. But on closer observation we find that there is no paradox. The two statements are not simultaneous according to relativity of simultaneity. Suppose event P is the event when Raj’s clock ticks 5 hours and event Q be the event in which Howard reaches point B. These two events are simultaneous in reference frame of Raj, but they are not simultaneous in Howard’s reference frame i.e. when Raj’s clock ticks 5 hours according to Howard, he is not at point B.</p>

<p>Now comes the main part of this thought experiment. Suppose if there is a wormhole at point B which connects directly to point A. Now Howard reaches the same point in space-time where Raj is, and still moving with constant velocity so that his frame is still inertial. Now what happens? Both of them again give the same statement that the other one is younger than me. As they have reached the same point in space-time the two statements must be simultaneous! </p>

<p>If we consider that wormhole connects two points only through space and not through time, than who is younger? If wormholes connects two points through both space &amp; time, does that mean they have time travelled with respect to one another?</p>

<p>I would be grateful to receive proper explanation regarding the above mentioned situation. Thank you!</p>

"274535","Would a Single Photon Refract?","<p>I was trying to come up with the reason for why light refracts upon entering a new medium and after consulting with the internet I believe my theory is known as the marching soldiers analogy. This analogy describes how when light hits a boundary at an angle, the near side of the light beam will slow down first whereas the far side will take longer to get to the boundary and slow down. Obviously, this causes a change in direction dependent on the time it takes for the far side to get to the boundary, which directly correlates with the angle at which the beam of light is incident upon the boundary.</p>

<p>My question is, does this work with just a single photon? If one particle/wave of light crosses a boundary between media, will it refract? The only way I could imagine this happening is if you took the photon to be a wave and thus have a little width (the distance between opposite peaks). Is this right or would a single photon just pass through with only a change in speed, not direction?</p>

<p>I know that Boltzmann's formulation of entropy is $S = k \quad log \quad W$ where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $S$ is the entropy of the given system, and $W$ is the number of microstates within the given macrostate - or, to put it another, simpler way, the number of ways you can arrange the pieces of a system such that the overall picture of they system is the same (in, say, a steam cloud, one could say the cloud-ish look is the macrostate and the position of each specific molecule is a particular microstate). Yet another way, this is configurations in phase space.</p>

<p>I read the log relation</p>

<p>$$log \quad a^b = b \quad log \quad a$$</p>

"274564","Why is there a time dependence in the Heisenberg states of the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory?","<p>I'm reading R. Haag's famous book ""<strong>Local Quantum Physics: Fields, Particles, Algebras</strong>"", 2nd edition, and I'm very puzzled by the way he treats the Heisenberg picture in the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory. It begins in section ""<strong>II.3 Physical Interpretation in Terms of Particles</strong>"", where, on page 76, he clearly states ""<em>Our description is in the Heisenberg picture. So $\Psi_{i\alpha}$ describes the state ""sub specie aeternitatis""; we may assign to it, as in (I.3.29), a wave function in space-time obeying the Klein-Gordon equation.</em>"" </p>

<p>Then, on page 77, he says: ""<em>Suppose the state vectors $\Psi_1$, $\Psi_2$ describe states which at some particular time $t$ are localized in separated space regions $V_1$, $V_2$.</em>"" From here on the whole construction begins.</p>

<p>I would very much appreciate it if an expert in Haag-Ruelle scattering or whoever knows the answer, would answer my question as to why a state vector in the <strong>Heisenberg picture</strong> like $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$ above depends on time, when it's common knowledge that there is <em>no time dependence</em> assigned to the state vectors in the the Heisenberg picture?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Up until recently I didn't even know how a scattering process might be described in the Heisenberg picture of QM, since once the initial state is prepared at $t_i = - \infty$ , this state will remain unchanged for all time and it will be the same for $t_f = + \infty$, and hence there could be no scattering (let alone particle production, 3-body scattering, rearangement collisions, etc.). How to solve this problem?
Then I have discovered one of the most lucid presentations in the paper of H. Ekstein, ""Scattering in field theory"", <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02745471"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02745471</a></p>

<p>The basic idea is the following: one prepares a state of the system at $t_i = -\infty$ by measuring a complete set of compatible observables represented by operators in the Heisenberg picture (i.e., time dependent), say $A(t_{i}), B(t_{i})$, etc. Obviously, this prepared state is a common eigenvector of these operators, say $|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalues (obtained in measurement) $a, b$,.... , i.e.,  $A(t_{i})|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle = a|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle, B(t_{i})|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle = b|a,b,...;t_{i}\rangle$, etc.</p>

<p>Then, one lets the system evolve from $t_i = -\infty$ to $t_f = +\infty$. Obviously, the state vector of the system remains unchanged, namely $|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle$ for any time $t$, with $t_i \leq t \leq t_f$, since we are in the Heisenberg picture, but the operators representing dynamical observables do change in time according to the Heisenberg equation of motion.</p>

<p>At time $t_f = +\infty$, one measures again the system choosing a complete set of compatible observables, say $C(t_{f}), D(t_{f})$,.... As a result of this measurement, the state of the system changes, at time $t = t_f$, from $|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle$ to $|c,d,...; t_{f}\rangle$, where $|c,d,...; t_{f}\rangle$ is a common eigenvector of the operators $C(t_{f}), D(t_{f})$,..., corresponding to the eigenvalues $c, d,$... obtained in the measurement (at time $t = t_f$), i.e. $C(t_{f})|c,d,....; t_{f}\rangle = c|c,d,....; t_{f}\rangle, D(t_{f})|c,d,....; t_{f}\rangle = d|c,d,....; t_{f}\rangle$, etc.</p>

<p>The quantity of interest is the transition amplitude from the Heisenberg state $|a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle$ to the Heisenberg state $|c,d,...; t_{f}\rangle$, and this is given by the S-matrix element $S_{a,b,...; c,d,...} = \langle c,d,...; t_{f}| a,b,...; t_{i}\rangle$.</p>

<p>To summarize: the key to understanding scattering in either the Schrodinger or Heisenberg picture is to realize that it implies 2 experimental operations, namely preparation at $t = t_i$ and measurement at $t = t_f$.</p>

<p>A logical approach to solving a scattering problem in the Heisenberg picture (as presented by Ekstein) is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>H0) For any given observable solve the Heisenberg equation of motion to find its dependence on time, i.e. the operator $A(t)$. </li>
<li>H1) For any Heisenberg operator (representing an observable) $A(t)$ find the asymptotic values $A_i = \lim_{t \rightarrow -\infty} A(t)$ and $A_f = \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} A(t)$</li>
<li>H2) Solve the eigenvalue problem for the asymptotic operators $A_i$ and $A_f$. The eigenvectors are the corresponding asymptotic scattering states.</li>
<li>H3) Select a complete system of compatible observables (CSCO) that corresponds to state preparation at $t = t_i$, denoted generically by $A_i$. Select a CSCO that corresponds to measurement at $t = t_f$, denoted generically by $C_f$.</li>
<li>H4) Calculate matrix elements between eigenvectors determined in step H2), namely $\langle c, t_{f}| a, t_{i}\rangle$, where $|a, t_{i}\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $A_i = A(t_{i})$, and $|c, t_{f}\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $C_f = C(t_{f})$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the Haag-Ruelle scattering, things are very confusing. The main argument is the same in all the books available. Instead of following the very logical steps H1)-H4) presented above, one starts by constructing a vector depending on a parameter $""t""$ and shows that this vector has limits when $|t|$ becomes infinite. I must say that this type of reasoning is reminiscent of the way one treats scattering in the Schrodinger picture (SP). In the SP, one starts with an arbitrary state vector $|\Psi (t)\rangle$ which is time dependent according to the SP and then must show that $|\Psi (t)\rangle$ has asymptotes when (the real time) $|t|$ becomes infinite.</p>

<p>I would be very grateful if you could help me with some answers to these questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>4) Can one obtain asymptotic scattering states for an ARBITRARY CSCO using the H-R method? This should be the case since one can prepare the initial state as one wants at $t = t_i$, and then can choose to measure what observable one wants at $t = t_f$, and hence the CSCOs corresponding to preparation and measurement must be arbitrary.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> @Pedro Ribeiro Your objections to Ekstein's construction are perhaps unfounded:</p>

<ul>
<li>I chose a discrete spectrum for CSCOs in my presentation from <strong>EDIT 1</strong> only to convey the general idea with minimum notation. In case of a continuous spectrum one can use spectral projection operators as per von Neumann's QM. </li>
<li>A Heisenberg operator $A(t)$ acts in the full Hilbert space, i.e. in the same Hilbert space on which the total Hamiltonian $H$ acts. The Haag theorem has to do with the fact that the free Hamiltonian $H_0$ and the full Hamiltonian $H$ act on 2 different Hilbert spaces. There is <em>no connection</em> between $A(t)$ and $H_0$ or its associated Hilbert space for any time $t$, finite or infinite. Hence, Haag's theorem has no bearing on $\lim_{t \rightarrow \pm\infty} A(t)$ and hence does not forbid the existence of this limit. Examples: If $A(t)$ commutes with $H$, then $A(t)$ is constant in time and the limit surely exists (see, e.g., the momentum operator). As a matter of fact, the whole LSZ idea is based on such limits! </li>
</ul>

<p>It's <strong>only one way</strong> a state can depend on <strong>time</strong> $t$ in the <strong>Heisenberg picture</strong>. That time $t$ has to be a time at which some Heisenberg operator, say $A(t)$, is measured on the system, and as an effect the state becomes an eigenvector $|a,t\rangle$ of that operator. Otherwise, state vectors in the Heisenberg picture do not evolve dynamically in time! One can look at <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/209038/what-is-the-description-of-measurement-in-the-heisenberg-picture"">my post</a>. </p>

<p>From your presentation is still not very clear if the parameter $""t""$ is the time at which one chooses to measure a CSCO on the system and obtains an eigenvector(?) $\psi_t$. For that one has to construct such a Heisenberg CSCO and show that $\psi_t$ is its eigenvector (corresponding to some eigenvalue) at time $t$. Can one show that? </p>

<p>In the meantime I've discovered some lecture notes by Haag published in <em>Lectures in theoretical physics, Volume III</em>, edited by Brittin and Downs, Interscience Publishers. Starting on page 343 Haag discusses his theory and in his own words says very clearly that the $\psi_t$ states are <em>manifestly</em> in the <em>Schrodinger picture</em>, and $t$ is regular time. Only the asymptotic limits of $\psi_t$ Haag considers to represent scattering states in the Heisenberg picture. But even that cannot work since $\psi_t$ has 2 limits, $\psi_{\pm} = \lim_{t\rightarrow\pm\infty}\psi_t$, and hence one needs 2 different Heisenberg pictures, one that coincides with the Schrodinger picture at $t = -\infty$, and a 2nd one, which coincides with the Schrodinger picture at $t = +\infty$. So, he doesn't stay all the time in the Heisenberg picture, but uses most of the time the Schrodinger picture, and in the end, apparently, 2 different Heisenberg pictures. However, it's <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.139.B684"" rel=""nofollow"">well known</a> that the Schrodinger picture does not exist in relativistic qft due to vacuum polarization effects!!! What is left of Haag-Ruelle theory, then??? </p>

Use Ampere's law with the appropriate Amperian loop to find the magnetic field between the plates and also above and below them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By Ampere's law:</p>

<p>$\vec{\bigtriangledown }\times \vec{B}=\mu_{0}\vec{J}+\mu_{0}\epsilon\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$</p>

<p>The current sheet due to the moving surface charge plate is $\vec{K}=\left \langle 0,\pm\sigma,0  \right \rangle$.
Since the charges are constant across the surface, it can be expected that the current is steady/ constant so this is a case of magnetostatic.
Additionally, the fact that the current is on the x-y plane suggests there is no x and y dependence. </p>

<p>By the Biot-Savart law for surface current:</p>

<p>$\vec{B}\left ( \vec{r} \right )=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi}\int \frac{\vec{K}\left ( \vec{r'} \right )\times \hat{\eta}}{\left \| \vec{\eta} \right \|^{2}}da'$</p>

<p>where $\vec{\eta}=\vec{r}-\vec{r'}$
where $\vec{r}$ is the vector distance from the origin to the field point and $\vec{r'}$ is the vector distance from origin to the source charge.</p>

<p>We expect the magnetic field not to be in the $\hat{y}$ direction due to the cross product in the integrand. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:I figured that if I rotate the plate 180 degrees about the z-axis in the CCW direction, the direction of the surface current changes-opposite to the direction of the surface current before the rotation-but the magnetic field continues to point in the positive z-axis which is a contradiction.</p>

It's pretty clear that it can't be done from a serve (zero spin), but perhaps it's possible during play to combine some particular incoming spin with a shot imparting some other spin such that the net result is a spiral spin. If it is, how? and if not, why not?</p>

<p>Here are the problem conditions: The ball is coming towards you. You get to choose its speed and axis of rotation (if any), and rotation speed. The only restriction is that the incoming axis of rotation can't already be in the direction of flight. You need to return the ball by hitting it at any desired point on its surface with a force and direction of your choosing. Can you create a hit that results in the outgoing ball spinning strongly about its direction of flight? You can ignore gravity, air resistance, etc. </p>

"274671","Calculate density of states from LCAO solution using Monte-Carlo methods","<p>When calculating the band structure of crystals by e.g. using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals"" rel=""nofollow"">LCAO method</a> of <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.94.1498"" rel=""nofollow"">Slater and Koster</a> I'm aware of two main methods how to determine the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_states"" rel=""nofollow"">Electron Density of states</a> from the dispersion relation $E(\vec{k})$.</p>

<p>With the Histogram method, a $\vec{k}$-vector mesh is spanned up in the reciprocal space and the Dispersion relation $E(\vec{k})$ is calculated.
Then all $\vec{k}$-vectors located in a certain energy interval $E+dE$ are summed up into a histogram which results in the Density of states $D(E)$. However this method needs a rather high k-vector density to resolve the van Hove singularities. </p>

<p>Thus a more common approach is the discretization of the asymmetric unit of the reciprocal space into tetrahedra and then linearly interpolating the DOS integral gradient according to the equation
$$ D(E)=\sum_{n} \int_{S_n(E)}{\frac{dS}{4\pi^3}|\nabla E_n(\vec{k})|^{-1}}$$ with $S_n(E)$ as the iso-surface in reciprocal space with the Eigenvalue $E_n$.
This so called Tetrahedron method is superior in requirements on $\vec{k}$-vector density and speed.</p>

<p>Now I'm interested in evaluating a potential additional possibility to generate the DOS by using the <a href=""http://stp.clarku.edu/simulations/ising/wanglandau/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Wang and Landau algorithm</a>, which has been employed for e.g. the 2D Ising model. This Monte Carlo algorithm has been demonstrated for systems which experience just one energy per e.g. $\vec{k}$ or spin state however. The whole method is interesting because it automatically weights the sampling of the k-space to adapt for low statistics energy points and is in the case of e.g. Ising model computationally efficient and does not need any special discretization of the reciprocal space since it is working in the energy domain.</p>

<p>Now my question: Is there any implementation of the Wang and Landau algorithm to cover multiple energies per state? I'm struggling with the concept of the Wang and Landau algorithm to just have one energy state per step and e.g. $\vec{k}$-vector instead of multiple energies as with the LCAO method.</p>

<p>My work : For 5kg block to just slide, the spring force should be equal to friction experienced by it which is equal to 10N. Now the external force F applied on 3kg block should be greater than or equal to the spring force + friction due to surface which is equal to 10N + 6N = 16N .

<p>There are a million different definitions. All of them get to the essence: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Disorder increases, stuff gets wild and wilder"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thermodynamics starts out of the curiosity: ""Why can my engine not be more efficient?""</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heat</strong> and <strong>Work</strong> are <strong>Internal Energy</strong> that's being transferred <em>(from and to the stuff that's being analyzed)</em>.</li>
<li>A <strong>heat engine</strong> wants to transform <strong>heat flow</strong> into <strong>work flow</strong>.   </li>
</ul>

<p>It will work considering that a gas under high pressure and high temperature (state 1)* wants to increase its volume (because it wants to be comfortable in a bigger playground).</p>

<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li>High pressured gas wants to expand [with heat source - stays warm] (positive work flow coming from a loss of its internal energy, but internal energy stays constant while gaining heat flow)</li>
<li>High pressured gas wants to expand [no heat source - loses internal energy] (generating positive work flow)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the gas doesn't want to expand anymore. It's chilling. Balance.</p>

<p>Everything would stop here naturally.</p>

<p>But we want it to work again.</p>

<p>We <strong>force compression</strong> to take all the stuff back, so everything can restart.</p>

<p><em>(Question 1)</em> Where does the energy required for the compression come from?</p>

<p>Anyways, the gas compresses, and gets hot because it feels uncomfortable again. But nah, we put something colder around so its increased Internal Energy stays constant (because it will run away as a heat release to the colder place).</p>

<p>And then at a certain point we take away the Cold thing, just so the gas cannot do anything else than keep its increasing internal energy (which comes from uncomfortability).</p>

<p><em>(Question 2)</em> Why would we divide the compression into two steps? Why can the gas not just be compressed and increase its internal energy so we have more temperature at the (state 1)* to restart all the stuff with more ""strength""? What's the point of releasing that internal energy it is gaining from the compression we are <strong>forcing</strong>?</p>

<p><em>(Question 3)</em> What's the real beginning of the 2nd law? Where does it come from and how does it apply here, in the engine?</p>

\begin{equation}
 T_{mn}:=\langle e_m, Te_n\rangle.

(I guess that the basis must lie in the domain of definition of the operator. For the following discussion it should be possible to assume, that the Hilbert space is $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and the operator is defined at least on the Schwarz functions)</p>

for fixed numbers $M, j ,k$ and that this implies convergence of the series everywhere. Cauchy-Schwarz doesn't seem to help to prove this. How can I show this result?

My system consists of three parts. Each is an harmonic oscillator and there's interaction with them, that is
$$H_0 = H_L+ H_R + H_C +H_{coup}$$</p>

<p>where $L$ stands for left, $R$ for right, $C$ for center and $coup$ for the coupling and</p>

<p>$$H_\alpha = \sum_n \frac{p_{\alpha,n}^2}{2m_\alpha}+ \frac{k_\alpha}{2}(x_{\alpha,n}-x_{\alpha,n+1})^2$$</p>

<p>$$H_{coup}= \frac{k_L}{2}(x_{L,1}-x_{C,1})^2+\frac{k_R}{2}(x_{R,1}-x_{C,N})^2$$</p>

<p>that is, I have a chain of spring and masses where I can recognise three parts and a coupling.</p>

<p>so I want to solve $(\imath \partial_t -H)G=\delta(t-t')\delta_{l,l'}$ or in matricial form
$$\begin{pmatrix}

<p>The answer is $$G(t,t')=G_0+\int_{t'}^{t}dt_1G(t,t_1)V(t_1)G_0(t_1-t)$$.</p>

<p>where $G_0$ is the green function of  $H_0$.</p>

<p>So to get $G$ I saw that is needed to make a gradient expansion and only can be solve to an order (for example at first order)</p>

<p>$$G(t,\omega) = G_0 + GVG_0+ \imath \partial_\omega G\partial_t V G_0$$ and so on.</p>

<p>My question are why I need to do a gradient expansion? Why isn't $$ G = [G_0^{-1}-V(t)]^{-1}$$ the solution? How can I compute the solution (fix point for example)? 
I saw that the solution is get by replacing $\tilde{G}=[G_0^{-1}-V(t)]^{-1}$ in the formula above so $$G = \tilde{G}+ \imath \partial_\omega \tilde{G} \partial_t V G_0$$
but I don't realise how to get it.</p>

"274765","Equation of motion in non-inertial frame","<p>I am reading the book <em>Classical Mechanics</em> by Taylor, and I have a question about the equations of motion in a non-inertial frame of reference, say $S$.</p>

<p>In particular, if $S$ has an angular velocity $\Omega$ with respect to some inertial frame of reference $S_0$, then the equation of motions in the rotating frame is given by:</p>

<p>$$m \ddot{\textbf{r}} = F + F_\textrm{cor} + F_\textrm{cf} \tag{$\dagger$}$$ where $F$ is the net forced as measured in any reference frame, and $F_{cor}$ and $F_\textrm{cf}$ are Coriolis and centrifugal forces, respectively. </p>

<p>Now, <strong>my question is</strong> that if I were to ""solve"" $(\dagger)$ for $\textbf{r}$ in some context, is it correct that I need to expresses the forces in the right hand side of the equation in the frame $S$? </p>

<p>In his discussion of centrifugal force in free fall on earth (pg 345 to 348), Taylor identifies the centrifugal force as $$F_\textrm{cf} = \Omega^2 R_\textrm{earth} \sin(\theta) \hat{\rho}$$, where $\rho$ is the unit radial vector in cylindrical polar coordinates, and since this force, as it is written, is with respect to the frame $S_0$, it needs to be ""rewritten"" in terms of the frame $S$. Doesn't it?</p>

<p><strong>Response to 'sammy gerbil's comment:</strong>
To my current understanding (which may be incorrect), the electrons use the air particles in between the terminals as a path of travel to reach negative/ground. Being the vacuum of space such particles would be non existent so I assume the bolt would not occur. However the concept intrigued me and not being 100% certain with my own resolution, I took the question here.</p>

"274776","Gauge invariance","<p>In the Schrodinger equation, the statement of electromagnetic gauge invariance is that observables don't depend on the electromagnetic gauge.  That is, if we let:</p>

<p>Why exactly is this 'form invariance' significant, and how is it related to the fact that observables (e.g. electric and magnetic fields, expectation values) are not changed by the choice of gauge?

  <p>Is a physical wave, dissipating due to loss of energy, best modeled by mean square convergence (i.e. convergence in $L^2$) or by pointwise or uniform convergence?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The fact that <a href=""http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/Lesson-2/Energy-Transport-and-the-Amplitude-of-a-Wave"" rel=""nofollow"">energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude</a> suggests that my suspicion is correct, perhaps at least from an ensemble perspective. In other words, it seems like convergence in the mean of the energy of the wave implies convergence in quadratic mean of the amplitude of the wave, thus if the mean energy of a wave dissipates linearly, then it should follow from that that the amplitude decays to $0$ in quadratic mean.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong>
I have found at least two papers which seem to discuss damping of solutions of the wave equation and $L^2$ convergence, which seems to suggest that it is a good model for waves dissipating energy.</p>

"274794","Difference between polarizability and dipole moment","<p>I am reading about Raman spectroscopy in general. And I learned that <strong>Raman spectra reflect the changes in the polarizability of a molecule, while the IR spectra reflect the changes in the dipole moment of a molecule</strong>. However, I do not have an intuitive feeling <strong><em>why that is so and what the key difference between the two is</em></strong>.</p>

<p>So, a dipole moment is just a displacement of charges, say, of electron cloud relative to the nuclei, after the molecule has been excited by a laser IR light. Dipole moment has an extent along one direction. Thus, it is denoted by a symbol $\mu_i,\ \ i=x,y,z.$</p>

<p>Polarizability is an intrinsic property of a molecule, showing the strength of the ability of the molecule to be polarized. The polarizability is represented by a tensor 3x3, $\ \ \alpha_{ij}, \ \ i,j=x,y,z$, reflecting the fact that the molecule can be polarized to a different extent in different directions. I guess, non-zero off-diagonal components (for example, for $\alpha_{xy}&gt;0$) mean that exciting the molecule by $x$-polarized light, can induce dipole moments in both $x$ and $y$ directions. Or only in $y$ direction?</p>

<p>It seems that dipole moment is along one axis, and polarizability has two coordinate components.</p>

<p>However, by a rotation of coordinate system, we can move to the frame $(x',y',z)$, one can represent the dipole moment as superposition of two dipole moments: $\mu_x=\mu_{x'}+\mu_{y'}=\mu_{x'y'}$, right? Now it has two components, as polarizability does.</p>

<p>So polarizability is the potential ability of the molecule to get polarized, while the dipole moment is something real that has been already induced. Right?</p>

<p>And what does it mean that Raman signal probes the polarizability of a molecule then?</p>

<p>The first website says there are about $0.02504\times10^{27}$ air molecules in 1 cubic metre. The the second one says the diameter of an air molecule is about $4\times 10^{-10}$m. Then the area of the molecule is about $4\pi\times 10^{-20} \approx 12\times 10^{-20}$.</p>

<p>Then we get the number of air molecules in one cubic metre to be about $12\times0.025\times10^7$, and in one cubic centimetre to be about $12\times0.025\times10^5 = 30000$.</p>

<p>Which led me to say: <em>""Oh, wait a moment...""</em>, and here comes the question:<br>
<strong>Is it (and if it is, how?), from everyday observation, plausible that there is indeed any such thing as Sgr A* at the center of our galaxy at all</strong>?</p>

<p>Earth rotates around itself and around the sun, and the sun orbits the center of the galaxy, in some kinda-elliptical but not alltogether trivial way.

Inevitably, while standing on Earth's surface I will face ""towards"" the center of the galaxy at some point, and ""away from"" it at other times.</p>

<p>Now, that means one day the black hole's gravitation (which is strong enough to hold together a galaxy, so it is not as trivial as e.g. the Moon's or Mars' gravitation) would add to Earth's gravitation, and on another day it would pull the opposite way.</p>

"274824","Efficiency of carnot cycle","<p>I am trying to derive the efficiency of a carnot cycle, but I constantly get something wrong.</p>

<p>Let a system consisting of two bodies not in termal equilibrium be termally isolated. Since the system is thermally isolated, the work $R$ which it does is just the change in its energy:
$$ |R| = E_0 - E(S),$$
where $E(S) $ is the energy in the equlibrium state as a function of the entropy. The system does maximum work when its entropy remains constant and therefore the process reaching the equilibrium state is reversible (for the derivative of $R$ with respect to $S$ is negative and because S cannot decrease). To achieve a reversible transfer of energy we need a working medium, which executes the well known carnot cycle: Isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression and adiabatic compression. For the calculation of the maximum work the working medium my be ignored since it is returned in its initial state. During the isothermal expansion the hotter body 2 loses energy, during the isothermal compression the cooler body 1 gains energy. For the decrease in energy:</p>

<p>$$ |R|=|\Delta E| = (E_2 + E_1) - (E_2 - \delta E_2) - (E_1 + \delta E_1) = \delta E_2 - \delta E_1, $$</p>

<p>with $\delta E_2 = T_2 \, \delta S_2$ and $\delta E_1 = T_1 \delta S_1$.</p>

<p>Since the process in reversible the entropy of the two bodies remains constant, or $\delta S_1 = - \delta S_2.$ Thus
\begin{align}
|R| &amp;= T_2 \, \delta S_2 - T_1 \, \delta S_1 \\
&amp;=  T_2 \, \delta S_2 + T_1 \, \delta S_2 \\
&amp;=  \delta S_2 \, (T_2 + T_1) \\
&amp;= \frac{T_2 + T_1}{T_2} \, \delta E_2.

I have also seen somewhere that it is a particle that cannot be reduced into other constituent particles.</p>

<p>While perhaps not a sure thing, seems like the decay indicates that the muon may be just a composite particle, perhaps consisting of one electron and two neutrinos? </p>

<p>Based on this, why does the muon fit with the above definition of an elementary or fundamental particle?  </p>

<p>I realize there are much more complicated, historical reasons as to why it was included in the Standard Model, but this question is just related so how it fits (or doesn't fit) the stated definition above.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we really can only get solid evidence of elementary vs. composite when we smash the particles together and see what comes out and compare that to all the masses, energies and momentum before and after?  Until we do that with muons, how can we know with much certainty?</p>

  <p>Moving electric charges create magnetic fields that in turn act back of electric charges. All these changes settle out into a new equilibrium configuration.

"274872","Shape and orientation of liquid surface in accelerating rocket tank","<p>I have a hard time explaining myself what would be the shape and the orientation of the liquid surface inside a rocket tank during acceleration (while the rocket motor are in operation). an example would be the surface of the Liquid oxygen inside the LOX tank of the Falcon 9 rocket first stage: is the surface perpendicular to the axis of the rocket (perpendicular to the thrust) or perpendicular to the relative acceleration (meaning including the gravity acceleration)?</p>

<p>The intuition from the ground would say that it is perpendicular to the relative acceleration. for example a car fuel tank when the car is linearly accelerating on an horizontal plane: the fluid surface tilts toward the direction of the acceleration and settle at an angle $\theta$ whose tangent is equal to the ratio of the horizontal acceleration over the gravity: $\tan(\theta) = \frac{a}{g}$</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9I0en.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9I0en.png"" alt=""car accelerating horizontally""></a>

<p>However, the rocket itself is submitted to the gravity, without any support to counteract it: if we stop the motor, the rocket is in free-fall (if we discard the air friction). So if we start our reasoning from the free-fall state, the fluid inside the tank doesn't see any forces acting on it. it is in a state of weightlessness in the tank and without any perturbation will stay where it is (with respect to the tank). Now if we apply the thrust, this is the only force that the liquid will see and will thus settle perpendicularly to this force, without any impact from the gravity. if this reasoning is correct, it means that the previous intuitive example of the car doesn't apply here. Most likely because the gravity is taken into account somewhere else.</p>

<p>I strongly think the right answer is the 2nd case, meaning the fluid will settle perpendicular to the axis of the rocket. I just cannot get around the equations to make up my mind correctly.</p>

<p>Does anybody could help me settle this problem? maybe with other examples or even the equations of the movement (that would be the best! I'm a bit rusted with non inertial frame...)?</p>

"274878","Can the order in which an equation is expressed imply causality in the physical model?","<p>Most physics textbooks will introduce Newton's 2nd law as
$$F = ma$$ or $$F = \frac{dp}{dt}$$
and I've seen educators that interpret this as ""the product of mass and acceleration lead to a net force"" or ""the change in momentum leads to a net force"". So they rather claim that more appropriate expressions of the 2nd law would be
$$a=\frac{F}{m}$$ and
$$\frac{dp}{dt}=F$$
thus implying a better sense of causality; that it's the force that comes first, and this is what leads to motion.</p>

<p>So my question is can the ordering of a physics mathematical model be such that it properly takes causality into account?</p>

<p>Or is there a more proper convention/notation to take causality into account?</p>

"274879","Can I swap quantum mechanical ground state for some classical trajectory distribution and have it sit still after the swap?","<p>Suppose that I have a single massive quantum mechanical particle in $d$ dimensions ($1\leq d\leq3$), under the action of a well-behaved potential $V(\mathbf r)$, and that I let it settle on the ground state $|\psi_0⟩$ of its hamiltonian,
$$
\left[\frac{\mathbf p^2}{2m}+V(\mathbf r)\right]\left|\psi_0\right&gt; = E_0\left|\psi_0\right&gt;.
$$
Suppose, because I'm a hater of QM or whatever reason, that I want to model this state of the system as an ensemble of classical trajectories. (More realistically, I might be interested in doing classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) calculations of some interaction that is hard to model using the full TDSE.) As such, I want to find a classical equivalent to my ground state that I can then use as starting condition for whatever simulation I want to do.</p>

<p>This wavefunction can be examined in phase space in a number of ways, such as using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_quasiprobability_distribution"">Wigner functions</a> or the  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glauber%E2%80%93Sudarshan_P_representation"">Sudarshan $P$</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husimi_Q_representation"">Husimi $Q$</a> representations, all of which offer different views into the state and different quasi-classical ways to understand it. My precise question is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way to translate wavefunctions $|\psi⟩$ of a quantum system into probability distributions $\rho(\mathbf r,\mathbf p)$ over classical phase space, in such a way that the eigenstates of a given quantum hamiltonian will be stationary states of the Liouville equation for the corresponding classical system?</li>
</ul>

<p>To be fully explicit, I want a map such that produces a classical density with the correct position and momentum distributions, i.e. $\int  \rho(\mathbf r,\mathbf p)\mathrm d\mathbf p = |⟨\mathbf r|\psi⟩|^2$ and $\int  \rho(\mathbf r,\mathbf p)\mathrm d\mathbf r = |⟨\mathbf p|\psi⟩|^2$, and ideally also for all possible quadratures at any angle. The classical $\rho(\mathbf r,\mathbf p)$ should remain stationary under Liouville's equation with a classical hamiltonian $H(\mathbf r,\mathbf p)$ that connects to the quantum hamiltonian via a classical limit or canonical quantization, in the general case, but I'm happy to restrict this to hamiltonians of the form $H(\mathbf r,\mathbf p) = \frac{\mathbf p^2}{2m}+V(\mathbf r)$, in which the correspondence is obvious.</p>

<p>More intuitively, I know that after the translation I will get a counterfeit $\rho( \mathbf r, \mathbf p)$ that doesn't actually describe what's going on, but at least I would like it to sit still once I let classical mechanics take over.</p>

So the work done is <strong>zero for either of the plates</strong>. The work done or potential should not change when the charge is brought from any side of the plate as both are state functions.

"274897","Standing waves: How are the waves not respecting the boundary conditions ""cancelled"" from the normal mode?","<p>I'm asking this question because I did not find any explanation in textbooks. </p>

<p>Consider a string fixed at both ends with an impulse provided to it (like in a guitar). The impulse can be described using Fourier integral and contains all the possible frequencies (with their weights). Nevertheless only the frequencies that satisfy the condition $$f=n \frac{v}{2L}$$ will ""survive"" and all the other components will disappear in a short time, after some reflections.</p>

<p>I would like to have an approximate, but quite clear, idea of how the wave components not satisfying to $(1)$ will disappear after being reflected some times. </p>

<p>Consider the situation in the picture, which is the case of $n=2$ standing wave (in black) and the red one and green one are the incident and reflected wave.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sUOFk.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sUOFk.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Because of $(1)$, in this case the incident and reflected wave add up to zero in both ends of the rope at any time $t$ (this is indeed the condition from which $(1)$ is derived).</p>

<p>Anyway, if this does not hold, i.e. the incident and reflected wave do not add up to zero in one of the ends of the rope, what happens to the wave?</p>

<p>In my view these two things must hold anyway:</p>

<ol>
<li>The end of the rope is physically fixed so it won't move in any case</li>
<li>Since the end does not move, the reflected wave is always reflected upside down. So also the components not obeying $(1)$ will be reflected up-side down</li>
</ol>

<p>But this does not explain why the components not satisfying $(1)$ eventually disappear. And it also looks like point 2. This is quite absurd since, if the waves are reflect upside down (like in picture), but independently from the fact that they satisfy condition $(1)$ or not, it seems to me that they should add up to zero at the ends of the rope in any case.</p>

<p>But this is surely incorrect and I'm quite confused on what happens to the components of the wave not obeying $(1)$, so any explanation is highly appreciated.</p>

For a given central body with the gravitational parameter $\mu$ and an orbit with the semi-major axis $a$ and the initial position $\vec{r}_0$ and velocity $\vec{v}_0$ at $t = t_0$ the position for a given time is given by:
$$
\vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 \ f(s) + \vec{v}_0 \ g(s)
$$
and the velocity by
$$
\vec{v} = \vec{r}_0\ \dot{f}(s) + \vec{v}_0\ \dot{g}(s)
$$</p>

<p>Where
$$
f(s) = 1-\left(\frac{\mu}{|\vec{r}_0|}\right) s^2 c_2(\alpha s^2) 
$$
$$
g(s) = t-t_0-\mu s^3c_3(\alpha s^2)
$$</p>

<p>With $\alpha=\frac{\mu}{a}$, $c_n$ the n-th Stumpff function and $s$ the solution of
$$
t-t_0=|\vec{r}_0| s \ c_1(\alpha s^2) + |\vec{r}_0| s^2 \ c_2(\alpha s^2) + \mu s^3 \ c_3(\alpha s^3)
$$</p>

<p>I am calculating $s$ by using Newton's Method and everything works fine for scenarios without thrust. The orbit is elliptical and closed, parabolic for higher initial velocities, if I choose a $\vec{r}_0$, $\vec{v}_0$ and $t_0$ and propagate $t$ forward.</p>

<p>For cases with thrust where I would change the velocity in every iteration</p>

<p>$$
\vec{v}_{k} = \vec{v}_{k-1} + \vec{a}_{k} \cdot \Delta t
$$</p>

<p>it is necessary to update $\vec{r}_0$ and $\vec{v}_0$ every time, propagate $\Delta t$ forward and repeat instead of choosing initial conditions and just propagating $t$ forward. In preparation for that I chose not to add any velocity so both approaches should yield the same results. </p>

<p><strong>Here is my Problem:</strong>

<p>blue: fixed initial conditions, propagating $t$ </p>

<p>red: propagating initial conditions, fixed $\Delta t$</p>

<p>I thought I could solve this by using a more advanced integration algorithm like Runge-Kutta and tried to calculate every iteration in as few steps as possible but I was not able to transform the equations so that I could use Runge-Kutta (since it is not an ODE) and reducing the steps did not help at all.</p>

"274926","Lorentz Transformation Example & Inversion","<p>We have two frames of reference: frame $F$ and frame $F'$ such that $F'$ is moving at velocity $v$ in the positive $x$ direction of $F$.
I get the overall idea of special relativity (time dilation, length contraction etc.) but I still have problems with working on the equations.
Lets say our velocity is $0.7c$ of $F'$. In $F'$ is a flash lamp and in distance $d'$ (in $x'$ direction) is a detector installed. The time between emission and detection of the light pulse for the observer in $F'$ is $t' = 1.5 *{10}^{-8}s$.</p>

<p>I calculated the distance $d'$, which is approx $4.5m$ and the timeinterval between emission and detection of the light-pulse for the observer in the resting reference frame: $t = 2.1 * {10}^{-8}s$ with $t = \gamma * t'$.</p>

<p>Now I have to to calculate the spatial distance $x$ between the emission and the detection for the observer in $F$. I tried 2 separate ways. First with the space-time invariant $$(c*t')^2 - (d')^2 = (c*t)^2-(x)^2$$ and got $6.3m$ iirc. The second way was using the Lorentz Transformation, the obvious solution I guess, but I'm new to special relativity so forgive me. That's the point where I got confused with the equations.</p>

<p>""The Lorentz transform for the $x$ coordinate is given by:
$$x'=\gamma (x-vt)$$
Everything on the RHS of this equation is measured in the frame $F$ and every thing on the LHS is measured in frame $F'$.""</p>

<p>That was posted in another thread. What I don't get is the reference of the variables. So my $x'$ is my $d'$ of course. My distance in the moving frame. My $x$ is what I'm searching for. The distance the resting observer is seeing (?). My velocity is the velocity of the moving frame (so $0.7c$, right?) and now my time.. I thought I should use the time measured in the resting frame, so $t = 2.1 * {10}^{-8}s$. But that doesn't give me the same solution as the the space-time invariant. If I take $t'$ however, it works. But why? Did I mix something up?
If $t'$ is the right time to use, why don't write the Lorentz Transformation differently? </p>

<p>Sorry but it really confused me - everywhere it is somewhat ambiguous and not absolutely clear what the variables are referring to. An example would help me a lot!  </p>

"274930","How do spatial curvature and temporal curvature differ?","<p>While looking at the metrics of different spacetimes, i came across the ""Ellis wormhole"", with the following metric:</p>

<p>$$c^2d\tau^2=c^2dt^2-d\sigma^2$$</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$$d\sigma^2=d\rho^2+(\rho^2+n^2)d\Omega^2$$</p>

<p>I note that the temporal term has a constant coefficient. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_wormhole"">Wikipedia article</a> mentions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There being no gravity in force, an inertial observer (test particle) can sit forever at rest at any point in space, but if set in motion by some disturbance will follow a geodesic of an equatorial cross section at constant speed, as would also a photon. This phenomenon shows that in space-time the curvature of space has nothing to do with gravity (the 'curvature of time’, one could say).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this metric would not result in any ""gravitational effects"".</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric"">Schwarzschild metric</a>:</p>

<p>$$c^2d\tau^2=(1-\frac{r_s}{r})c^2dt^2-(1-\frac{r_s}{r})^{-1}dr^2-r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)$$</p>

<p>Here we have a non-constant coeffcient for the first component. And this metric clearly has an attractive effect on particles, e.g. it's geodesics have the tendency towards $r\rightarrow0$.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does that mean the gravitational effect comes primarily from a ""curvature of time"" and not from spatial curvature? I assume part of the answer has to do
with the motion through time being dominant for all but the fastest particles?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the spatial curvature the primary cause of the visual distortion, e.g. the bending of light paths, in these metrics?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm getting the picture that temporal curvature primarily affects objects moving fast through time (static and slow objects), and spatial curvature primarily affects objects moving fast through space (photons). Is this a good picture or completely wrong?</p></li>
<li><p>If the spacetime around an ""Ellis wormhole"" is purely spatial, does that mean the faster i move (through space), the more i would feel the attraction and also second order effects like tidal forces?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there physical metrics, e.g. valid solutions for the EFE which only have temporal curvature but no spatial curvature? Would such an object behave like a source of gravity, without the gravitational lensing?</p></li>
<li><p>If such objects would be valid, would that mean you could pass them unharmed or even unnoticed at high speeds (moving fast through space), but would be ripped to pieces if you are moving slowly (moving fast through time)?</p></li>

<p>I would like to apologize as well for my bad english since it is not my mother language.</p>

<p>Recently I watched a video from professor Michio Kaku which makes me curious about the lack of information related to dark energy / dark matter.</p>

<p>To start with I would like to think that before the big bang, nothing else existed, even the empty space, so everything was concentrated in a single high density ball of pure energy with a mass tending to be infinite.</p>

<p>When the big bang took place, this ball of energy expanded in all directions, expanding the own space and everything inside trough all directions.
Today we know that nothing can go faster than speed of light, however this afirmation is based on the fact that the light is travelling on vacuum or empty space. </p>

<p>Considering a supposition that our own dimension was created together with the big bang including the space, this law may not be applied at the very first moments after the big bang since the objects could be travelling ahead of the speace itself.</p>

<p>If we consider that during the big bang, 80% of the energy released started travelling faster than light in all directions, creating the own space on it's way, and then we had the remaining matter travelling below the speed of light behind it.</p>

<p>Since nothing on space can travel faster than speed on light, we can not see the objects that initially started travelling faster than speed of light, however their gravitional effects can be feel at the the galaxies near the boundaries of the universe which are being pulled away from each otther.</p>

<p>The big questions about dark energy and dark matter is that something should exist otherwise galaxies won't have enough mass to be formed as well as the fact that the speed the universe is expanding is increasing over time.
If instead of having dark energy acting on the space between the matter, we have simply a massive amount of matter outside the know boundaries of our universe pulling the galaxies away from the centre of the universe, could this be a plausible solution for the dark matter / dark energy question?</p>

<p>Again sorry for the stupid question, but it was something that came into my mind and even after looking for answers on internet I could find anything related to it.</p>

<hr>

<p>(Since the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude, so if the expected energy of a wave goes to zero, then its ensemble amplitude goes to zero in quadratic mean. Likewise, if the expectation of a wave function goes to zero, then its probability density will decay to zero in $L^2$/quadratic mean.

"275001","Error in calculating binding energy of Beryllium 8","<p>I don't know where I am going wrong with regards to calculating the binding energy of $^8$Be. This is what I am doing:
I look up online and find that the mass excess of $^8$Be is $5305 \mu$u. Thus, the atomic mass is ($8 + 5305\mu$)u. The nuclear mass is therefore (because of $4$ electrons): $8 + (5305 - 4 \times 548.6)\times 10^{-6}$ = $8.003$u. We have $4$ protons and $4$ neutrons, so their rest mass is: $4(1.0073 + 1.0087) = 8.064$ u. The mass deficit is therefore: $8.064 - 8.003 = 0.0609$ u. This corresponds to a binding energy of $0.0609 \times 931.49 = 56.72$ MeV. However, if I compare this with literature I get a binding energy of $56.50$ MeV. Can someone please tell me where I am going wrong?</p>

"275007","Where do I thermodynamically see the energy and entropy of a ball bouncing on the ground until it stops?","<p>I am trying to clarify some of the concepts that I learned so far in my thermodynamic adventure.</p>

<p>For that purpose I will set up a salad with those concepts, so I can see not only their isolated definition but the practical relationship between them all.</p>

<p><strong>SCENARIO:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suppose</strong> I am in a room and I have a ball in my left hand.</p>

<p><strong>Suppose</strong> the ball is my thermodynamic system because it's the thing I want to analyze. Hence the room is the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Suppose</strong> I let the ball fall free.</p>

<p><strong>THERMODYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Potential energy</strong> is gravity pulling the ball downwards. <strong>All</strong> this potential energy is <em>part of</em> the <strong>internal energy</strong> of the system.</p>

<p><em>Part of</em> it, because another part is made of the kinetic energy of the system's particles (be it a gas or be it a whatever).</p>

<p>It will hence swim down across the air, bounce on the ground, and swim back up...</p>

<p>...A few times, while losing its internal energy as <strong>heat flow</strong> that goes into the surroundings.</p>

<p>Is there any work flow while the ball is swimming down in contact with the air? - I say swim because it represents better that there is an opposition with the air, falling sounds too easy -</p>

<p>There is a positive work flow when the ball is touching the ground, because it is compressing its volume, and hence there is work being done on the system.</p>

<p>There is a negative work flow when the ball is bouncing back from the ground because it is expanding again, and hence the system is doing the work.</p>

<p>Being entropy <strong>the freedom of the system</strong> to have the <strong>possibility</strong> to set itself into ""entropy"" amount of different micro-states, where can I see this entropy?</p>

<p>While falling the room gets the heat flow, so the room increases its entropy while the ball itself is losing entropy?</p>

<p>But while ""swimming up"" against gravity, the ball gaining entropy again (not as much as the previous bounce because it doesn't get so high).</p>

<p>What if the room is very hot and the ball is very cold? If heat is not flowing out of the ball, is it still losing internal energy while falling? If the room was exaggeratedly hot in contrast to the ball, would that help the ball gain more energy and hence bounce higher than before?</p>

<p>In the end, the ball will have lost all its kinetic energy and will be in thermal balance with the room. It has lost all the entropy it could have lost, and that is the reason why it doesn't keep acting. If it had some entropy to lose, it would definitely keep doing something (everything happens because everything wants to provide entropy to the universe, and it cannot say no until it has completely been robbed of its entropy?).</p>

<p>Instead using dimensional regularization in QFT, for instance, $d = 4 - 2\epsilon$), one may imagine, thinking to the wordline representation of QFT (associated to the Schwinger representation of the propagator), (see for instance this paper of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9205205"" rel=""nofollow""> Strassler</a>), staying in $4$ dimensions, but modifying the propagator (for instance, in the Schwinger representation of the scalar massless propagator, in position space, for each space-time coordinate $x$, we may consider using (formally)  $x^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ different of $2$, instead of $x^2$), this would correspond (possibly assuming euclideanization) to a (space-time) fractional diffusion equation (see this paper of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0702419"" rel=""nofollow"">Mainardi and all</a>, and also the definition of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">stable distributions</a>- $\alpha$ is known as the stability parameter). A possible hint would be that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_integral"" rel=""nofollow"">Mellin-Barnes representations</a> are used both in the fractional diffusion material, and also in QFT.</p>

<p>If my question makes sense, are there concrete examples in the litterature of such a (speculative) alternative point of view?</p>

"275027","How are the classical and quantum picture of electromagnetic radiation related?","<ol>
<li><p>The classical picture of EM radiation is the picture of a wave with electric and magnetic field oscillating perpendicularly to each other and to the direction of propagation. Let us neglect the magnetic field part. The energy carried per unit time by such a wave is proportional to the intensity of the wave which is defined as E^2. Here E is the electric field. Away from the source, E of the EM wave falls off by (1/r) where r is the distance from the source. So the energy carried by the EM radiation falls off by (1/r^2).</p></li>
<li><p>The quantum picture of EM radiation is the picture of a Photon. The energy of a photon is defined as (h*f) where h is Plank's constant and f is the frequency of the radiation. So the energy of Photon is fixed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Correspondence</strong> If in in classical description, one says that an EM wave has high amplitude or high intensity or high energy then the quantum mechanical way of interpreting is to say that the EM wave has high number of photons. So amplitude/intensity/energy of EM wave corresponds to number of photons.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> It is possible that at a point far away from the source, the electric field which falls of as (1/r) will attain a value such that k*(E^2)=h*f. where k is the proportionality constant between energy and intensity of the EM radiation. i.e. the energy of EM radiation will correspond to single photon. What will happen beyond this particular distance r? Beyond this distance E will fall off as (1/r) and energy will fall off as (1/r^2) in the classical picture. But the energy of the photon which only depends on frequency should remain constant (there can be no division or waning of the photon). How then is it possible to have the classical and quantum pictures consistent to each other beyond the distance r ?. </p>

<p>Now in textbooks/internet what I can find are examples of one d-fold degeneracy. One diagonalizes $V$ given in the basis of $H_0$ in the degenerate $d$-dimensional subset. 
The eigenvalues are the first order energy corrections and linear combinations of the eigenvectors in the $H^0$ basis give the correct zeroth order states (just a basis transformation in the respective subset).</p>

<p>Then to get the first order state corrections I apply the normal perturbation theory, namely </p>

<p>Now to my question. Of course I can just do diagonalize each degenerate subset on its own. I get energy corrections and zeroth order states but  what does this mean for the state corrections?

When talking about the same frame of reference, this Electromagnetic field behaves just like what we call the $\vec{E}$ field.

<hr>

<p>I have the following equations:</p>

<p>$$
\quad\Delta G(\bar{r}|\bar{r}') = -4\pi\delta(\bar{r}-\bar{r}') \\ \tag1$$$$
 \quad\Delta\Psi(\bar{r}) = -4\pi\delta(\bar{r}-\bar{r}')\tag 2$$$$
\quad \\ 
\bar{r} \in V \\
\Psi(\infty) = 0 \text{ (Free space)} 
$$</p>

<p>Now in my notes it says that we treat 1 and 2 canonically, i.e. we do:</p>

<p>$$\int_V [\Psi.\Delta G - G.\Delta\Psi]d\bar{r} $$</p>

<p>So my first question: what happened here? What does ""canonically"" mean in this context? I know the word means something like standard, or not random, but I don't see why someone would do this step. I see that it allows us to use Green's 2nd integral theorem, but how was this known a priori?</p>

<p>Then it says that after applying Green's theorem and the definition of the (dirac) delta function, we find:</p>

<p>$$\Psi(\bar{r}') = \int_V G(\bar{r}|\bar{r}')\rho(\bar{r}) d\bar{r} \\
\Rightarrow \Psi(\bar{r}) = \int_V G(\bar{r}|\bar{r}')\rho(\bar{r}') d\bar{r'} \text{ (symmetry)}
$$</p>

<p>Again, how? I don't see how Green's theorem and the delta function lead to this equation.</p>

<p>I did however find this:</p>

<p>$$ \Delta\Psi(\bar{r}) = -4\pi\rho(\bar{r}) \\
\Rightarrow \Delta\Psi(\bar{r}) =  \int  -4\pi\delta(\bar{r}-\bar{r}')\rho(\bar{r}')d\bar{r}'\quad^*\\
\Rightarrow \Delta\Psi(\bar{r}) = \int\Delta G(\bar{r}|\bar{r}')\rho(\bar{r}')d\bar{r}'\\
\Rightarrow \Psi(\bar{r}) = \int_V G(\bar{r}|\bar{r}')\rho(\bar{r}') d\bar{r'}
$$</p>

<p>Mass including dark matter/energy = 10^53 kg / 4.9% = 2E54 kg</p>

<p>SR = 2*G*m/c^2 = 3E27 m = 7 times the radius of the OU.</p>

<p>Anything wrong so far? I want to write that in wikipedia. Any unaccounted effect of matter expanding thus gravity at a distance not reflecting the position of where matter is now or so? I read the SR of the OU is equal to the radius of the OU, making the OU ""flat"".</p>

<p>Normally I would call a mass in a sphere 1/7 of it's SR a black hole. But here I'm assuming that the universe is filled with matter fairly evenly (despite irregularities like galaxies, supermassive black holes, stars or voids on a small scale :), so gravity generally cancels and everything is free to go wherever it wants and cross Schwarzschild radii which are everywhere depending on where you pick the center of the OU.</p>

<p>Now, would it be possible to get stuff out of a black hole if it's gravity was cancelled by nearby matter similar to the OU? Maybe a black hole cluster with overlapping event horizons. Would singularities remain (naked?) singularities and stuff could escape the singularities it was originally bound to? Could stuff eventually escape the black hole cluster, perhaps if there were also non singularities like neutron stars and normal stars in the cluster?</p>

"275094","Derivation of the radial momentum operator","<p>I have been studying Quantum Mechanics and when my book was going through the Hydrogen wave equation, it was talking about this equation:
$$ \frac{p_r^2}{2\mu} +\frac{L^2}{2\mu r^2}+V(r)=E$$
I completely understand how they got to this formula, but then they said they could use the above equation to write Schrodinger's equation for spherical coordinates using de Brogie's relations and appropriate operators.  My book then said finding said operators is a ""lengthy though not particularly difficult exercise.""  It then said that the appropriate operator for <em>p<sub>r</sub><sup>2</sup></em> is the next equation:
$$(p_r^2)_{op}=-\hbar^2\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2\frac{\partial}{\partial r})$$
I am fairly new to operators so I tried to derive this operator.  My result was:
$$(p_r^2)_{op}=-\hbar^2 r\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r\frac{\partial}{\partial r})$$
I realize this result is wrong, and from reading other forums, I'm pretty sure I got the above result from finding the radial component of the momentum operator and then just operating on itself or in essence ""squaring"" it.  This leaves me completely lost on how to get the correct equation from my book.  If somebody could help me understand how I can derive the proper operator that would be great.</p>

"275102","The need for Black Energy: 3 challenges against it","<p>You say that Black Energy is something which is needed to overcome the gravitational pull of our expanding Universe. You say that the Universe would collapse into a singularity due to gravitational pull between galaxies. Yet, we see that opposite is happening and, therefore, there must be some Dark Energy, which keeps the Universe to expand.</p>

<p>Yet, you say that there is no problem with distant galaxies receding faster than speed of light because nothing pushes them -- it is space that appears between us en them. Thus, you say that the Universe expands due to new born space between the points in the universe, which can overcome some physical laws. Why cannot it then overcome the law of energy, needed to overcome the gravitational collapse of the Universe? If your new space can push the galaxies faster than speed of light, it can do so without any energy, I suppose. Why one but not the other?</p>

<p>Moreover, there is equal amount of galaxies on the left and on the right from you. This means that we do not even need any energy to maintain/expand the Universe. When the pull is equal from all the distances, we do not experience any force at all. The Universe is stable by itself, without any Dark Energy.</p>

<p>Finally, even if this my latter consideration is flawed and galaxies still tend gravitationally together despite of the uniformity and infinity of the universe, I would also like to point out that the <em>energy means mass</em> and, thus, Dark Energy can only increase the gravitational pull between the galaxies!</p>

<p>This is my naive counter argument to the popular explanations. Does it has any holes in it? </p>

<p>The questions I'm going to ask are all related to <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/59634/44126"">this answer that Chris White provided</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first equation the third RHS term $\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^nb_{ij}x_ix_j$ is for $n=2$, $(b_{11}+b_{21}+b_{12}+b_{22})x_1^2+2(b_{11}+b_{21}+b_{12}+b_{22})x_1x_2+(b_{11}+b_{21}+b_{12}+b_{22})x_2^2$ which is if we set $(b_{11}+b_{21}+b_{12}+b_{22})=A$, $Ax_1^2+2Ax_1x_2+Ax_2^2$. Now since we know that in the quadratic approximation of two variable functions we get something like $ax_1+bx_1x_2+cx_2^2$ where $a=\frac12\frac{\partial{f(x_{1_0},x_{2_0})}}{\partial{x_1}}$  $b=\frac{\partial{f(x_{1_0},x_{2_0})}}{\partial{x_1}\partial{x_2}}$ and $c=\frac12\frac{\partial{f(x_{1_0},x_{2_0})}}{\partial{x_2}}$. Now these are all different however the sum I'm talking about here ends up being $Ax_1^2+2Ax_1x_2+Ax_2^2$ which I don't understand since the coefficients shouldn't be equal.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you provide further clarification on why $\sum_{i=1}^nb_{ii}E(x_i^2)$ appears in the second equation? Chris here says: <strong>To second order, you have to account for the expectations of the squares of the inputs not matching the squares of the expectations.</strong> Still, I'm having trouble understanding this.  </p></li>

"275111","Matter beyond event horizon","<p>Assuming that antimatter is matter with time arrow reversed, would it be right to say that matter beyond black hole event horizon then would become antimatter because of space and time axes exchanged? Would not black hole then appear like a nice universe consisting from antimatter that slowly expands as matter falls into it?</p>

<p>I do not claim anything just want to find out how wrong the idea is. Although, it is not really related to the question but I would like shortly explain where from my crazy idea that matter can indeed move to the opposite time direction is coming. I think that there was no Big Bang but initially was space filled with matter fluctuating back and forth in time (field fluctuating between matter and antimatter). 
Since there was no real matter - matter and antimatter fluctuated from vacuum and annihilated chaotically and hence there were no state transitions (movement) which we perceive as time - there was no time, in fact there was no matter either - just vacuum. 
But at some random event indicated as 'shortly after Big Bang', CP-symmetry got broken, which caused antimatter to disappear and gave rise to the time which we since perceive as going forward (if by some other event antimatter had won our time would go into opposite direction - but this does not mean 'back in time'). CP-violation caused universe expansion, but there was no initial rapid expansion, since universe did not arise from a singularity, but from a homogeneous space, which is in sync with recent Cosmic background radiation observations.</p>

"275126","Fermi-Dirac distribution definition and meaning","<p>I'm studying statistical mechanics and band theory, with two different professors.
My statistical mechanical teacher defines the Fermi Occupation function this way:

where $\beta=kT$. He this defines the Fermi level as $E_F=\mu(T)$ as T tends to zero.

<p>So, about this I have some questions because even at this point I'm very confused. What does F(E,T) represent? Is it a probability distribution? And if not, what does it represent?
I got very confused because, as $E_F$ is defined as being independent on the temperature, thus a constant in the picture (depending on the solid considered I suppose) I see from the image that there are no fermions over $E_F$, even when the temperature increases. Why is that? If, for example, I consider a semiconductor I have that the Fermi level lies in the middle of an energy gap, so at very low temperatures I have no conduction. But, as the temperature increases, I need some electron over $E_F$ for the conduction to take place. </p>

<p>With the other professor is a different story. He defines
\begin{equation}
F(E,T)=\frac{1}{1+e^{\beta({E-E_F})}}

"275143","Do singularities exist?","<p>I'm a student of physics and soon, astro. I have what is probably considered to be a basic question:</p>

<p>It is said that the fact that the universe is currently expanding implies that it was once infinitesimally small. This is discussed here: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/2269/"">Does red shift evidence necessarily imply that the universe started from a singularity?</a>. </p>

<p>But we cannot extrapolate all the way back to the very, very beginning, the moment of that singularity. The laws of physics, particularly GR, break down at the moment of creation due to the infinite density of that point. I also understand that many people don't believe such a singularity, a physical thing of literally infinite density and literally infinitesimally small size, could possibly exist, now or ever (including in a black hole), even though theoretically it works out at least for the case of a black hole. </p>

<p>So I am wondering: is it generally believed that singularities, that is, <em>physical things</em> of <em>literally</em> infinite density and <em>literally</em> infinitesimally small size exist in the universe? Is there any hard evidence whatsoever to suggest that</p>

<p>a) at the moment of creation, time t=0, the universe was in fact <em>infinitesimally</em> small and not just, you know, very small, and</p>

"
"275149","Question About $E=hf$","<p>Einstein's famous equation starts out as $E=hf$. He was the first person to boldly intertwine Planck's Constant with the energy of electromagnetic waves.</p>

<p>If we factor the speed of light out of Planck's Constant, we get the following equation with the following constant:</p>

<p>$$E=(2.210\cdot{}10^{-42}kg\cdot{}m)cf$$</p>

<p>If we factor the Planck Length out of that resulting constant, we get the following equation with the following constant:</p>

<p>$$E=(1.36\cdot{}10^{-7}kg)l_pcf$$</p>

<p>And if we factor the Plank Mass out of that resulting constant, we get the following equation with the following unit-less constant:</p>

<p>$$E=6.25m_pl_pcf$$</p>

<p>Finally, we now recognize that $6.25$ is wonderfully close to $2\pi$. So we end up with the following:</p>

<p>$$E=2\pi m_pl_pcf$$</p>

<p>I've never seen this anywhere before, but then, I'm not very well travelled in the world of particle physics. It seems like a very nice equation though. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has seen Einstein's Nobel Prize equation expressed this way before. How could we interpret this equation as it relates to the energy of electromagnetic waves?</p>

<p>If we rearrange it as follows we might think of something:</p>

<p>$$E=m_p(2\pi cf)l_p$$</p>

<p>That's in a $Force\times{Distance}$ configuration where we'd be accelerating a Planck Mass at a rate defined by $2\pi cf$ over a distance equal to the Planck Length.</p>

<p>Or, if we rearrange it as follows we get a kinetic style to it where $f = \frac{c}{\lambda}$:</p>

<p>$$E=\frac{2\pi l_p}{\lambda}{m_p}{c^2} $$</p>

<p>A Planck Mass is moving at speed $c$ with that kinetic energy. The familiar prefix of $\frac{1}{2}$ appears to be gone.</p>

<p>The ""work version"" with the $2\pi cf$ acceleration is pretty interesting to me. That acceleration could also be expressed as $2\pi\lambda f^2$. What would cause such an acceleration? A gravitational field could cause an acceleration and then we'd have such an equation that makes use of a ""virtual mass"" at some distance from the Planck Mass discussed above:</p>

<p>$$2\pi cf = \frac{Gm_v}{r_v^2}$$</p>

<p>And if we plug in some reasonable numbers we could possibly get a qualitative feel for this. Using a gamma ray frequency and the mass of the sun we get:</p>

<p>$$2\pi(2.998\times 10^8\frac{m}{s})(4.0\times 10^{19}Hz) = \frac{(6.67408\times10^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot{s^2}})(1.989\times10^{30}kg)}{r_v^2}$$</p>

<p>Solving for $r_v$ we get:</p>

<p>$$r_v = 4.197\times10^{-5}m$$</p>

<p>To me, that's pretty incredible. If you want to accelerate a Plank Mass at a rate of $2\pi cf$, based on a gamma ray frequency, then you'd need a sun-sized mass at an extremely short distance away from the Plank Mass in order to accomplish it.</p>

"275152","What is the approx. separation of chiral Weyl nodes in recently discovered Chiral anomaly in Dirac semi-metals?","<p>Recent papers have shown evidence for the existence of the long sought after Chiral axial anomaly to be present in certain Weyl semi-metals....
Usually they talk of the parallel B and E fields inducing violation of symmetry so as to create oppositely chiral ""Weyl nodes"" (that results the ""chiral magnetic effect"" in violation of conserved current).....and sometimes they show evidence of Fermi arcs .
But in all the reports I have seen I have never seen any indication of the magnitude of the spatial separation of the nodes....or even the number of nodes per amount of volume of material, etc. .... Usually only comments about the phenomenology between two nodes.... </p>

<p>So 1st...what is a ""node""? Isn't it the place of accumulation of a number of chiral ""quasi-particles""??...
and 2. What is the typical spatial separation of two nodes and what determines the amount of that separation?
(I mean are we talking microns or inches?? )
....or am I missing the whole idea due to my ignorance of solid state physics.?
 Thanks for the help.</p>

"275168","Doubt in lecture 1 of Allan adams' course on QM","<p>Did anyone understand the reason for why the results in the experiment white->hardness->color, and white->hardness->mirrors->color came different? what is the difference between the two experiments?</p>

<p>In the lecture adams describes two properties of electrons, which he names color and hardness, both being binary in nature, i.e. white/black, and soft/hard.
He claims these are alternate names for two conventionally well known properties of electrons, and shall be referred to via these names at the moment.</p>

<p>Moving ahead he describes an apparatus called a property box. A color box can tell the color of an electron, and a hardness box can tell the hardness of an electron. 
The principles involved here are that the properties are repetitive, i.e. once color turns out to be white it remains white, and same goes for hardness. However if you determine the hardness of a set of white electrons and then try figuring out their color, it turns out that the odds are 50/50 in favor of both white and black. Thus this experiment is indicative of the uncertainty principle.
Also these two properties are unrelated, i.e. a white electron can be any of the two: hard, soft.
Now he describes an apparatus wherein he uses white electrons, passes them through a hardness box, and then uses mirrors to aggregate all of those electrons into a single beam and then passes that single beam through a color box. The result herein is that all the electrons are white. He claims that mirrors cannot do any altercations except for redirecting of the electron path.
My question is that if mirrors are not changing anything, then why are the two experiments giving different results? According to me the apparatus is entirely identical.

"275169","How to obtain symmetry algebra?","<p>By making an infinitesimal coordinate transformation $x^\mu$ --> $x^\mu + \epsilon^\mu$ corresponding to a symmetry of a given theory, one can obtain the Killing equation and hence obtain the Killing vector $\epsilon = \epsilon^\mu\partial_\mu$. For example, for conformal symmetry group the Killing vectors are</p>

\begin{align} &amp; m_{\mu\nu} \equiv i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu) \,, \\
&amp;p_\mu \equiv-i\partial_\mu \,, \\
&amp;d \equiv-ix_\mu\partial^\mu \,, \\
&amp;k_\mu \equiv i(x^2\partial_\mu-2x_\mu x_\nu\partial^\nu) \,. \end{align}

<p>Now, each symmetry transformation leads to a conserved charge and they satisfy an algebra. For the conformal group, the algebra of conserved charges are</p>

\begin{align} &amp;[D,K_\mu]=-iK_\mu \,, \\
&amp;[D,P_\mu]=iP_\mu \,, \\
&amp;[K_\mu,P_\nu]=2i\eta_{\mu\nu}D-2iM_{\mu\nu} \,, \\
&amp;[K_\mu, M_{\nu\rho}] = i ( \eta_{\mu\nu} K_{\rho} - \eta_{\mu \rho} K_\nu ) \,, \\
&amp;[P_\rho,M_{\mu\nu}] = i(\eta_{\rho\mu}P_\nu - \eta_{\rho\nu}P_\mu) \,, \\
&amp;[M_{\mu\nu},M_{\rho\sigma}] = i (\eta_{\nu\rho}M_{\mu\sigma} + \eta_{\mu\sigma}M_{\nu\rho} - \eta_{\mu\rho}M_{\nu\sigma} - \eta_{\nu\sigma}M_{\mu\rho})\,, \end{align}

<p>To obtain the above algebra, one can just consider the Killing vectors as charges and find the commutator relations. But, I know that this method does not work always since for example in 2D CFT, the algebra of Killing vectors is the Witt algebra, while the charges satisfy Virasoro algebra and the latter differs from the former by a central extension.</p>

<p>So my question is, when does the method of finding the algebra of charges by just taking the commutator of Killing vector fail? </p>

"275170","What's the most stable crystal lattice for a collection of spherical toy magnets?","<p>I recently found a bunch of tiny spherical toy magnets, and I've been having fun sticking them into various shapes.</p>

<p>In two dimensions, there are only two possible packings of the magnets: a square and a hexagonal lattice. There's some interesting physics going on between these two phases. </p>

<ul>
<li>In the square phase, alternating lines of magnets need to have opposite polarity. In the hexagonal phase, they need the same polarity. As a result, the phases really don't want to coexist; trying to build a crystal alternating between the two falls apart.</li>
<li>The hexagonal lattice appears marginally more stable. When I construct a 'random' 2D lattice by quickly smushing a ball of magnets, it usually looks more hexagonal.</li>
<li>Despite this, the square lattice is kinetically stable for large lattices. The transition point seems to be about $2 \times 2$. I was able to build a large tower with a $2 \times 2$ square lattice cross section, but it spontaneously turned hexagonal with a little tap.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't been able to analyze the 3D case, where the structures are more complicated, because I don't have enough magnets. What physical models are behind this toy? What are the most stable structures in 3D?</p>

<p>When some force is applied to an elastic material (like rubber), the object will deform to different shape than the initial shape. Then, the mass at $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is moved to other position $(x_{new}, y_{new}, z_{new})$.</p>

<p>I'd like to get $(x_{new}, y_{new}, z_{new})$ for all $(x_{init},y_{init},z_{init})$ during the force is being applied. I believe $(x_{new}, y_{new}, z_{new})$ is determined if the force, the properties of the object (Young's modulus etc.), the initial shape are given.</p>

"275182","Heterotic/F-theory duality beyond spectral covers","<p>In string theory models there is known to be a duality between heterotic string theory and F-theory. In particular, a heterotic model (on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau three-fold) can have an F-theory dual (on a K3 fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold), where bundle data on the heterotic side is dual to geometric data on the F-theory side.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with the realisation of the duality in terms of the spectral cover construction for the vector bundle on the heterotic side. (This is developed by Friedman, Morgan, and Witten in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9701162"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9701162</a> and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9709029"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9709029</a> .) However, not every vector bundle can be given a spectral cover description (in particular, I believe the vector bundle must be semi-stable and 'regular' on every fibre, with 'regularity' defined in the papers by Friedman, Morgan, and Witten, and both of these conditions can separately fail for a general vector bundle).</p>

<p>My question then is whether there is an F-theory dual for a heterotic model in the absence of a spectral cover description for the vector bundle on the heterotic side. A related question is whether it is known whether there always exists an F-theory dual for a heterotic model (on an elliptic fibration), but I believe there is no definitive answer to this in the literature.</p>

"275184","Blender physics: Size of ice cubes affects crushing of nuts","<p>By using a blender to prepare my breakfast shake (containing ice and nuts amongst others, see ingredients below), I made the following observations.</p>

<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Using large ice cubes will result in a smooth shake with properly crushed nuts, <strong>except</strong> for one quite large ice cube remaining in an ellipsoid shape.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> However, using smaller ice cubes results in all ice being crushed, but there will remain larger chunks of partially crushed nuts. Often, a few hazelnuts seem quite unharmed.</p>

<p>In both cases, the effect of running the blender in a different mode (pulses, lower speed) or blending longer does not really make a difference. </p>

<p>I am not a physicist, but my intuition tells me that the largest objects in the mix cause most turbulence, which forces the smaller objects into the blades of the blender in a probabilistic sense. Meanwhile, the force of the vortex is not large enough to help crushing a large / the largest ice cube. If there are only small ice cubes, there is not enough turbulence to crush the nuts before all ice is crushed, i.e. the probability of the nuts hitting the blades is so low, that it would take comparatively long to crush them.</p>

<p>Is that intuitive generalization consistent with fluid dynamics?</p>

<p>Or is a general explanation prohibited by the physical complexity of blending process, i.e. I am  just encountering an odd combination of blender geometry, ingredient properties (geometry, density, temperature) and ingredient ratios and it would be impractical/impossible to create a model to support my theory.</p>

<li>400 ml Oat milk</li>
<li>40 g Rolled oats</li>

<hr>

<p>Further observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>I also tried small ice cubes in the form space invaders, but it had no noticeable effect on the nuts.</li>
<li>Adding banana has no noticeable effect on ice or nuts whatsoever.</li>
<li>In case 1, sometimes, also smaller ice cubes remain, but they are significantly smaller than the largest remaining ice cube and there are still no nut chunks.</li>
<li>Rarely, larger bits of strawberries or brambles did remain while ice and nuts have been crushed, but I do not remember the ice cube configuration.</li>
<li>The rigidity of the nuts seems to have an effect. Walnut chunks remain less frequent that hazelnut chunks. I used almonds a few times and the blender seems not capable of destroying them satisfactory. </li>
</ul>

<strong>Additional information</strong></p>

<p>The Blender used is <a href=""http://www.severin.com/kitchen/kitchen-appliances/blenders/multimixer-smoothie-mix-go-sm-3737"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>. The inner diameter is $11\,\mathrm{cm}$ at the top and $6.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ at bottom. </p>

<p>The regularly used ice cubes have a basic cylindrical shape with a diameter of $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ and varying height. The ""large"" ones are $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ to $6\,\mathrm{cm}$ tall. So let's say that large ice cubes are identified by having $V &gt; 35\,\mathrm{cm^3}$. But the bag contains also many smaller ones and fragments of cylinders.</p>

<p>In comparison, the space invaders are approximate cuboids of equal size with $V \approx 6\,\mathrm{cm^3}$.</p>

<p>As I am writing this, I realize that the amount of ice varies dramatically due to my optical misestimation of the ice volumne (I rarely used the scale when adding the ice). To replace 4 large cubes, over 20 invaders are needed. When I used them, I barely added 10.</p>

<p>Concerning the nuts, I had a look at the remainings of today's shake (which was a ""case 1"" BTW). The solid particles had a maximal diameter of $\approx 2\,\mathrm{mm}$, so I consider everything having $V &gt; 65\,\mathrm{mm^3}$ (sphere with a diameter of $\approx 5\,\mathrm{mm}$) a ""larger chunk"".</p>

"275211","Does the Alcubierre drive have a theoretical upper speed limit?","<p>Every now and then, it's claimed that the Alcubierre drive has an upper speed limit. While superluminal, this is often brought up as an argument why such a drive, even if it were to turn out to be viable and possible to construct, would still provide only limited usefulness for interstellar travel.</p>

<p><em>If</em> the Alcubierre drive turns out to actually enable macroscopic travel at apparent superluminal velocities, then <strong>is there anything about it, as currently hypothesized, that would put a theoretical upper limit on the attainable velocity</strong> (lower limit on travel time between two arbitrary points in real space), similar to how Special Relativity imposes an upper speed limit equivalent to the speed of light?</p>

<p>The closest I have been able to find is Wikipedia's discussion on how, at $10c$, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive#Wall_thickness"">wall thickness</a> of less than $10^{-32}$ meters (versus the Planck length $1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ meters) would be required, but it is not clear to me whether or not this would impose an upper speed limit for the Alcubierre drive as there are no comparable calculations quoted for other velocities.</p>

<p>Note: I'm not asking about violations of causality introduced by the general concept of faster-than-light travel, but specifically about this one aspect of the Alcubierre drive. <em>If</em> doing so makes this question easier to answer in an understandable fashion, then let's posit simply an ideal universe with a single observer aboard the spacecraft and no message-passing back and forth.</p>

"275212","Is there a system of units that replaces time with light-distance?","<p>I would like to start this by saying that my motivation for asking is that I find relativity very difficult to deal with using the SI system. It strikes me that the problem with this system is the fact that it was based on an earlier system that assumed time to move at a constant rate under all circumstances. Since we now know this not to be true, is there, or should there be a better system out there? One that is based on the constant speed of light, not a constant rate of time.</p>

<p>For example, if MKS became MKL where 1L = 1 Light-Gigametre (the time it takes light to travel 1 Gigametre - <em>not in seconds</em>) then in the world of slow moving 
objects we would have 1s approximately equal to 1L/3 and all would be fine. </p>

<p>By my reckoning (and probable naivety) 
it should also hold out in the world of fast moving objects where time starts misbehaving but L remains constant.</p>

<p>Does such a system already exist?</p>

<p>UPDATE -</p>

<p>What I am looking for is definitely not some scaled version of our existing base units. 
I'm looking for a system of units that ditches time altogether and starts from scratch with light-distance in its place.
A fundamental change that affects all of the units that have a time component.</p>

<p>I was prompted to look at Planck Units and in partiular Planck Time. At first sight this appeared to be what I was looking for 
i.e. it is based on light-distance. Unfortunately it looks like this has just been equated to a fixed number of seconds. 
The problem is that as soon as you make it a scaled version of time you have lost its true meaning and it is no longer true 
light-distance. It can't be, because light travels at a constant rate and time doesn't.</p>

<p>Update 2</p>

<p>From a practical point of view, as a stationary observer on Earth, during the same period of our clock based time I could be looking 
at a light bouncing off a distant stationary mirror and measure one distance of light (2d) or I could be watching the same scenario on a fast moving passing 
vehicle and measuring a different distance of light (a V shape of height d). So in effect, the light-distance measured by me (L) would reflect the amount 
of earth time being experienced at the source of the light. So L (unlike t) would be dependent on what was being observed, as it should be. Or should it be that in a system where light-distance is replacing time we should just say that in both cases the light moved by 2d?</p>

<p>I was doing experiment about the gyroscope's precession speed and I made my own gyroscope, which is the one in the picture. It is the motor-powered gyroscope as I found out the one made with bearing provided friction so much and the rotation of the disk stopped quickly. I first balanced the gyroscope with the counter mass so that the system remains horizontally. Then, I added the supplementary mass to sea how's its motion changed.</p>

<p>However, what I noticed doing the experiment was the gyroscope's precession got faster and faster as it rotated 1st period, 2nd period, .. and goes on. This was almost the same no matter where the supplementary mass is positioned, close to the string or close to the counter mass. Do you think the physics of this result is because of the motor? As the motor kept provide the power?</p>

<p>Not sure how correct this is but here it goes:
$E = 1kg\times c^2$ is the (kinetic) energy equivalent of 1kg mass.
I am hazy about the next step, 1kg mass having kinetic energy of $1kg\times c^2$ w.r.t. to a stationary point would appear to be moving at what (relativistic) speed?  (not sure even if the first step is correct)</p>

"275220","Use of angular diameter to determine distance in special relativity","<p>Summary: at relativistic speeds, if you compute a planet's relative distance using angular diameter (roughly proportional to 1/angular diameter), will that computed distance increase or decrease linearly, assuming you are traveling directly towards or directly away from the planet? Example:</p>

<p>A ship starts at Earth, accelerates to 0.8c, and travels to a planet P 10 light years away.</p>

<p>The ship pilot knows the diameter of P, and uses the angular diameter to compute his distance from P.</p>

<p>When the ship accelerates from 0 to 0.8c, P's angular diameter does not change (is that correct?), so the pilot defines that diameter to correspond to 10ly (he's using the reference frame of the Earth/planet for this definition only).</p>

<p>The journey takes 7.5 years ship clock time; as the ship approaches t=7.5, P's angular diameter tells the pilot his distance is approaching 0.</p>

<p>Question: does the distance as computed from the angular diameter (which is roughly the reciprocal of the angular diameter) decrease linearly during the pilot's journey? The angular diameter is perpendicular to direction of flight, so foreshortening shouldn't be an issue, but I could be wrong about this.</p>

<ol>
<li>All the devices have Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS receptors whose model/specs can be known if necessary. Therefore The device can be located and we can also know its orientation.</li>
<li>The number of devices in the network may vary widely, from only 2 devices to 50 devices online, even though cases in which there are more devices are more likely and better to consider.</li>
<li>The environment where the devices will move around will be a crowded space, if that causes interferences in the signals.</li>
<li>As the devices move in the space, its position updates.</li>

<p>One obvious test would be to use potential observers in a two-slit experiment and observe interference patterns formed by the observers themselves.

"275239","Justifying assumptions for deriving Poissonian photon statistics","<p>Suppose you have a perfect monochromatic (angular frequency $\omega$) laser beam in vacuum, such that it is well described classically by
\begin{equation}
E(t,x)=E_0\sin(\omega t-kx+\phi)
\end{equation}
with the $x$-coordinate along the beam, where $E_0, \phi$ do not depend on time and $k=\omega/c$.</p>

<p>I am reading the book ""Quantum Optics"" by Mark Fox.
Fox derrives that such a beam must have Possonian photon statistics (i.e. the probability that a fixed segment of the beam contains exactly $N$ photons follows a poisson distribution). To do so, he makes a few assumptions that I have trouble justifying. I was hoping you could help me. The derrivation goes as follows:</p>

<p>Take a segment of the beam of length $L$ that has a well-defined time independent average number of photons in it, $\overline{N}$. Fox wants to take the length large enaugh, so that the number $\overline{N}$ can be taken to be an integer, which I do agree should be possible to reasonable precision, however I see no need for it (That is, I do see why $L$ should be assumed large, but no reason why one would want $\overline{N}$ to be an integer).</p>

<p>The next step is to subdivide the beam segment into $n$ sub-segments of equal length, which are so small, that the probability of finding a photon in an indivicual sub-segment is negligible. Fox now claims that the probability $P(N)$ to find exactly $N$ photons in the segment of length $L$ is given by the binomial distribution
\begin{equation}
P(N)=\binom{n}{N}\left( \frac{\overline{N}}{n}\right )^N \left(1- \frac{\overline{N}}{n}\right )^{n-N}.
\end{equation}
He then simply takes the limit $n\to\infty$ to arrive at the Poisson distribution.</p>

<p>This derivation seems a bit like a trick to me intuitively. If anyone knows a better one, I'd love to hear it. As far as I can see, the assumptions necessary to arrive at the binomial distribution above are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The probability of finding two photons in a sub-segment is zero.</li>
<li>The photons are distributed along the beam randomly.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can see how the first assumption is justified by ""the probability of finding a photon in an indivicual sub-segment being negligible"". However, it would be interesting to examine how much of an effect it has on the end result, if one allows a very small such probability. I'm unsure how to approach that question, since the expression $\overline{N}/n$ for the probability can no longer be used.</p>

<p>My doubts mainly concern the second assumption: The photons are distributed completely randomly. That includes (very unlikely) scenarios where, if you have an extremely long beam segment, the detection rate could vary noticably with time, enaugh to be registered by a photon counter. That would be inconsistend with the initial assumption of a perfectly coherent, homogenous beam. How does one arrive at this conclusion (photons distributed perfectly randomly) just from knowing what the best classical description (i.e. my $E(t)$ formula) of the laser beam is?</p>

"275265","How is Berry phase connected with chiral anomaly?","<p>Recently I've read in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0747"" rel=""nofollow"">one article</a> very strange way to describe chiral anomaly on quasiclassical level (i.e., on the level of Boltzmann equation and distribution function). </p>

<p>Starting from Weyl hamiltonian
$$
H= \sigma \cdot \mathbf p,
$$
which describes massless chiral fermions, performing unitary transformation 
$$
|\psi\rangle \to V|\psi\rangle,
$$ 
where $|\psi\rangle$ is fermion state and $V$ is $2\times 2$ matrix that diagonalizes $\sigma \cdot \mathbf p$, such that
$$
V\sigma \cdot \mathbf pV^{\dagger} = |\mathbf p|\sigma_{3},
$$ 
we obtain
$$
\langle f|e^{iH(t_{f}-t_{i})}|i\rangle \equiv \left(V_{\mathbf p_{f}}\int Dx Dp \text{exp}\left[\int dt(\mathbf p \cdot \mathbf x - |\mathbf p|\sigma_{3}-\hat{a}\dot{\mathbf p})\right]V_{\mathbf p_{i}}^{\dagger}\right)_{fi}, \quad \hat{a}_{\mathbf p} = V_{p}\nabla_{\mathbf p}V^{\dagger}_{p} 
$$
By choosing $+1$ helicity and neglecting off-diagonal components of $\hat{a}_{\mathbf p}$ (which is called adiabaticity approximation; it is not valid near $\mathbf p = 0$), we obtain following quasiclassical action:
$$
S = \int dt (\mathbf p \dot{\mathbf x}) - |\mathbf p| - \mathbf a \dot{\mathbf p})
$$
Quantity $\mathbf a$ (which is called <strong>Berry phase</strong>) plays the role of gauge field in momentum representation, with curvature
$$
\mathbf b = \nabla \times \mathbf a = \frac{\mathbf p}{|\mathbf p|^{3}} 
$$
Effect of this Berry phase is absent when $\dot{\mathbf p} = 0$.</p>

<p>If we, however, turn on external EM field, it becomes to be relevant. We obtain that the phase volume element is
$$
dV = \frac{d^{3}\mathbf x d^{3}\mathbf p}{(2\pi)^{3}}\Omega (\mathbf p), \quad  \Omega (\mathbf p) = (1 + \mathbf b \cdot \mathbf B)^{2},
$$
where $\mathbf B$ is magnetic field. This captures chiral anomaly effect,
$$
\tag 1 \dot{\rho} + \nabla_{\mathbf r}(\rho \dot{\mathbf r}) + \nabla_{\mathbf p}(\rho \dot{\mathbf p}) = 2\pi \mathbf E \cdot \mathbf B \delta^{3}(\mathbf p), \quad \rho = f\Omega ,
$$
with $\mathbf E$ being electric field and $f$ being distribution function.</p>

<p>I don't understand how this berry phase leads to description of chiral anomaly. They appear due to different reasons (anomaly arises because of non-trivial jacobian of chiral transformation, while berry phase arises because of formal manipulations), anomaly has topological nature connected with difference of number of zero modes of Dirac operator, while Berry phase hasn't such origin. Finally, the rhs of $(1)$ is non-zero only when adiabaticity approximation is violated (and hence the result isn't valid).</p>

<p>Could someone explain me the reason due to which berry phase somehow describes effects of anomaly on quasiclassical level?</p>

"275284","Modelling a water-bottle rocket, version 2. (long post warning)","<h1>Task</h1>

<p>The modelling of a Water Rocket's flight profile for a set of predefined variables.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I am wondering if my assumptions and mathematics are correct.  If they are, this is merely an informative post.</p>

<h2>Schematic</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/KXuQs7J.jpg"" alt=""rocket""></p>

<h2>Concerns/Things to take into account:</h2>

<p>As the rocket starts to lift off, (assuming that with the specs I have, it can), water is ejected through an opening at the bottom of the rocket. This causes a pressure decrease of the air in the tank and an increase in volume of the air.  This in turn causes the force applied by the air to lessen over time and as a result, the acceleration of the rocket decreases. </p>

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>Subscript 1 and 2 represent the air and water, respectively. The physical dimensions of the rocket are described in the schematic.  </p>

<p>Starting off with conservation of mass on the water over the control volume</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dm_2}{dt} = -\rho_2 v_2 A_2 \tag{1}$$ </p>

<p>Applying Bernoulli's equation to the water:</p>

<p>$$ v_2^2 = 2gh_2 + \frac{2(P_1-P_{atm})}{\rho_2} \tag{2}$$ </p>

<p>The height of the water in the rocket is given by</p>

<p>$$ h_2 = V_2/A_1  \tag{3}$$</p>

<p>It follows from Eq (1) that</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dh_2}{dt} = -v_2\frac{A_2}{A_1} \tag{4}$$</p>

<p>Differentiating Eq (2) with respect to time:</p>

<p>$$ 2v_2\frac{dv_2}{dt} = 2g\frac{dh_2}{dt} + \frac{2}{\rho_2}\frac{dP_1}{dt} \tag{5} $$</p>

<p>I will return to Eq (5) once it can be simplified.</p>

<p>Because the gas expands as the water leaves the rocket, the gas volume can be described by</p>

<p>$$ V_1 = V_3-V_2 \tag{6}$$</p>

<p>Differentiating with respect to time
$$ \frac{dV_1}{dt} = \frac{dV_3}{dt} - \frac{dV_2}{dt} \tag{7}$$</p>

<p>Where $ V_3 $ is constant and $ V_2 = m_2/\rho_2 $. Substituting into Eq (7):</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dV_1}{dt} = - \frac{1}{\rho_2}\frac{dm_2}{dt} \tag{8}$$</p>

<p>Substituting Eq (1) into Eq (8) yields</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dV_1}{dt} = v_2 A_2 \tag{9}$$</p>

<p>Assuming that the gas undergoes adiabatic expansion, </p>

<p>$$ du = dW \tag{10}$$</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$$ \frac{du_1}{dt}  =  C_{p_{1}}\frac{dT_1}{dt} \tag{11}$$</p>

<p>and 
$$ \frac{dW_1}{dt} = -P_1\frac{dV_1}{dt} \tag{12}$$</p>

<p>Substituting Eq (11) and (12) into (10) yields</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dT_1}{dt} = \frac{-P_1}{C_{p_{2}}}\frac{dV_1}{dt} \tag{13}$$</p>

<p>Then, substituting Eq (9) into (13) :</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dT_1}{dt} = \frac{-P_1}{C_{p_{2}}} v_2 A_2 \tag{14}$$</p>

<p>Now, I am able to find an expression for the $dP_1/dt$ term in Eq (5).</p>

<p>Assuming ideal gas law and differentiating it with respect to time with constant moles delivers:</p>

<p>$$ P_1\frac{dV_1}{dt} + V_1\frac{dP_1}{dt} = n_1 R \frac{dT_1}{dt} \tag{15}$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{dP_1}{dt} = \frac{n_1 R}{V_1} \frac{dT_1}{dt} - \frac{P_1}{V_1}\frac{dV_1}{dt} \tag{16}$$</p>

<p>Now, substituting Eq (9) and (14) into (16):</p>

<p>$$\frac{dP_1}{dt} = \frac{n_1 R}{V_1} (\frac{-P_1}{C_{p_{2}}} v_2 A_2) - \frac{P_1}{V_1}(v_2 A_2) \tag{17}$$</p>

<p>Returning to Eq (5) and substituting in Eq (4) and Eq (17):</p>

<p>$$ 2v_2\frac{dv_2}{dt} = 2g(-v_2\frac{A_2}{A_1}) + \frac{2}{\rho_2}(\frac{n_1 R}{V_1} (\frac{-P_1}{C_{p_{2}}} v_2 A_2) - \frac{P_1}{V_1}(v_2 A_2)) \tag{18} $$</p>

<p>Simplifying</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dv_2}{dt} = -g\frac{A_2}{A_1} - \frac{ n_1 R P_1}{V_1 C_{p_{2}} \rho_2} A_2  - \frac{P_1 A_2}{V_1 \rho_2} \tag{19}$$</p>

<p>Now, for the physical rocket, a force balance:</p>

<p>$$ F_r = F_g + F_D  + F_T \tag{20}$$</p>

<p>Where $ F_g, F_D, F_T $ is the gravitational force, drag force, and thrust.   </p>

<p>Gravitational force is given by</p>

<p>$$ F_g = -m_r g \tag{21}$$</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$$ m_r = m_e + m_1 + m_2 \tag{22}$$</p>

<p>The empty mass of the rocket is given by $ m_e $ and is a constant. The mass of the gas inside the rocket is $ m_2 = n_2  MW_2 $
Drag is given by</p>

<p>$$ F_D  = -\frac{1}{2}\rho_{atm} C_d A_c v_r^2 \tag{23}$$</p>

<p>The thrust force is a bit more complex:</p>

<p>$$ F_T = \frac{d (m_2 v_2)}{dt} \tag{24}$$</p>

<p>$$ F_T = m_2\frac{d v_2}{dt} + v_2\frac{dm_2}{dt} \tag{25}$$</p>

<p>Now, substituting Eq (1) and (19) into (25) yields:</p>

<p>$$ F_T = m_2 (-g\frac{A_2}{A_1} - \frac{n_1 R P_1}{V_1 C_{p_{2}} \rho_2} A_2  - \frac{P_1 A_2}{V_1 \rho_2}) + v_2 (-\rho_2 v_2 A_2) \tag{26}$$</p>

<p>$$ F_T = -g m_2\frac{A_2}{A_1} - \frac{ n_1 m_2 R P_1}{V_1 C_{p_{2}} \rho_2} A_2  - \frac{m_2 P_1 A_2}{V_1 \rho_2} -\rho_2 v_2^2 A_2 \tag{27}$$</p>

<p>Now, $F_r$ can be expanded to</p>

<p>$$ F_r = v_r \frac{dm_r}{dt} + m_r\frac{dv_r}{dt} \tag{28}$$</p>

<p>simplifying using Eq (22) where $ m_e $ and $ m_1$ are constant</p>

<p>$$ F_r = v_r \frac{dm_2}{dt} + m_r\frac{dv_r}{dt} \tag{29}$$</p>

<p>A new variable $F_{total}$ is used to describe the right hand side of Eq (20)</p>

<p>Substituting Eq (28) and $F_{total}$ into Eq (20) yields</p>

<p>$$ v_r \frac{dm_2}{dt} + m_r\frac{dv_r}{dt} = F_{total} \tag{30}$$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dv_r}{dt} = (F_{total} + v_r \rho_2 v_2 A_2 m_r) / m_r \tag{31}$$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{d x_r}{dt} = v_r \tag{32}$$</p>

<p>The solution can be found by simultaneously solving Eq (1), (4), (9), (14), (17), (19), (21), (23), (27), (29), (30).</p>

"275295","How to calculate acceleration vector of a moving object to intercept a stationary object","<p><strong>The short version</strong>: I'm moving on a certain straight-line trajectory (two dimensions only, thank goodness), and I want to intercept a stationary object, with constraints on maximum acceleration and maximum speed. I can't seem to come up with a formula to do it.</p>

<p><strong>The long version</strong>: I'm writing a computer game to entertain myself. I've figured out a lot of the equations I need, but this one is stumping me. I think it's a basic missile guidance problem in 2D with a stationary target, but I can't work it out, and I haven't found anything online to...<em>guide</em> me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I forgot to mention, my game (so far) has no gravity and no friction. Not even real mass, just acceleration and velocity vectors.</p>

<p>I'm at point (Xs, Ys), moving at constant velocity (XVs, YVs), not accelerating. I want to go as quickly as possible to the target, which is stationary at point (Xb, Yb). I don't need to slow down on the approach, I just want my trajectory to intersect the point. And I don't have to be moving at top speed when I get there, I just want to get there. Here's how I'm thinking about the acceleration and speed constraints:</p>

<p>My max speed is MSs, and my max acceleration +/-MAs (I'm not sure how to express this properly. I mean, √(Xsa^2 + Ysa^2) &lt;= MAs, where Xsa and Ysa are the x/y of my acceleration vector). Is there a way to calculate the necessary acceleration (Xsa, Ysa) to get me to my target? I mean, I'm sure there is a way, but I can't find it.</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://14.139.172.204/nptel/CSE/Web/101108054/module6/lecture15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> on missile guidance with a couple of promising equations, but I'm not sure how to translate them into what I need. When I plug in the numbers I have, I get back nonsense, so I think I'm just misreading the equations. I have some algebra and trig, and some <strong>very</strong> basic calculus, but no physics background.</p>

<p>The simpler the answer, the better. Or if it's a complex answer, a link to an explanation of the math would be most helpful.</p>

"275303","Force/Torque done on Pulley Clarification","<p>If we have an Atwood machine that has two masses, $M_1$ and $M_2$, where $M_2$ is laying flat on a table and $M_1$ is suspended by a rope connected through a pully to $M1$. The pulley can rotate, and for the sake of my question, there is no internal friction in the pulley. The table is frictionless as well.</p>

<p>Here is a quick diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/o2ZRn.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/o2ZRn.png"" alt=""Atwood machine with M1 and M2 attached to a rotatable pully""></a></p>

<p>I tried to attempt to find all the forces, but what stumped me is what would be the effect of $M_1$ to the pulley. If we release the system, then $M_2$ will provide a force of gravity and thus create a torque on the pully. Because surface of the table is frictionless, there doesn't seem to be any force done by $M_1$ because of Newton's 3rd law. If the pulley was a point particle that had no effect on the system (and so no torque), I can easily see that $M_1$ moves because of $M_2$. When we go back to our original question at hand, even if $M_2$ moves $M_1$, how would $M_1$ end up affecting the pulley. I'm quite lost and I'm assuming this goes against my intuition of real life- that is with friction.</p>

"275366","Doubt regarding question on Bogomolny equations","<h3>PROBLEM:</h3>

<p>Let $\bf E$ and $\bf B$ be static, and source free electric and magnetic fields in $\mathbb R^3,$ respectively which are infinitely many times differentiable. Also assume that they satisfy either of the following : $\mathbf E = \mathbf B ~\textrm{or}~ \mathbf E = -\mathbf B.$ (Bogomolny equations). Prove that as long as the equations describe a finite energy configuration, $\mathbf E = \mathbf B = 0.$</p>

<h3>MY ATTEMPT:</h3>

<p>Consider a very large boundary $S,$ compared to the region under consideration. Since $\int \mathbf E^2~\mathrm dv$ all over space is a finite value(since the energy configuration described is finite), the integrand must go to zero at infinity. Or, at my chosen surface $S,~~ \mathbf E = -\textrm{grad}(V) = 0.$ Thus we see that the potential $V$ is the same everywhere on the surface $S$ (since $\bf E$ is zero everywhere on the surface). Let $V(S) = a.$ So the problem reduces to the boundary problem, $V(S) = a$ at all points on $S$ and also the laplacian of $V$ is zero everywhere inside $S$ (since it is source free). One evident solution to this is $\bf E = 0,$ (as a result of which $\bf B = 0,$ from the Bogomolny equations). Hence, this must be the only solution by uniqueness.</p>

<h3>MY DOUBT:</h3>

<p>Is it okay to start working in the boundary conditions using this surface $S$ as I defined it? If not, can the definition of $S$ be changed to satisfy the rest of the solution? If that cannot be done, please suggest other solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In quantum physics, if you apply an outside force to two atoms, it can cause them to become entangled, and the second atom can take on the properties of the first atom. So if left alone, an atom will spin in all directions. The instant it is disturbed it chooses one spin, or one value; and at the same time, the second entangled atom will choose an opposite spin, or value. This allows scientists to know the value of the qubits without actually looking at them.</p>

<p>Does the magnet gradually lose strength and eventually drop the weight, or will the weight stay suspended forever?  If the latter case, wouldn't that be a violation of conservation of energy, in that it should take a certain amount of force to keep the weight suspended against gravity, and the energy to do that has to come from somewhere?  And also in that case, would it make any difference if instead of leaving the static load on the magnet, the weight is instead repeatedly detached and then gradually brought towards the magnet from below until it 'jumps' up to contact the ceiling (presumably making the weight travel upwards expends some energy, from somewhere)?</p>

"275392","Negative Magnetoresistance from Frozen-Out Spin-Flip Scattering","<p>A free electron gas would have zero magnetoresistance; it takes two carrier types to get ordinary magnetoresistance, which is always positive in sign.</p>

<p><a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.170.552"" rel=""nofollow"">Beal-Monod and Weiner</a> explain the negative magnetoresistance found in very dilute magnetic alloys, in terms of the spin-flip scattering of conduction electrons off the impurities.</p>

<p>Their argument seems to be the following. </p>

<p>Consider the case where $\mu_BH&lt;k_BT$.  </p>

<p>A conduction electron in initial state $|\vec{k_i},\downarrow\rangle$ scatters off of an impurity with spin component $M_s$ into the final state $|\vec{k_f},\uparrow\rangle$ (and the impurity will have spin component $M_s-1$.  If energy is conserved, $|\vec{k_f}|=|\vec{k_i}|$.  The net change in energy will be $-2\mu_BH$. </p>

<p>Now, only states within $k_BT$ of the Fermi Level participate in scattering processes, so the energy of this new state will be, at most, $\epsilon_F+k_BT-2\mu_BH$.  It seems like I must have made some sort of mistake here, as the new state will have energy between $\epsilon_F+k_BT$ and $\epsilon_F-k_BT$, which is allowed by the Pauli principle.  They argue that ""the final-state spin-up electron has a total energy (kinetic+Zeeman) less than $\epsilon_F$ by at least $2\mu_BH-k_BT$ and this scattering process is forbidden by the exclusion principle.""  <strong>What am I misunderstanding here?</strong>  Their result seems to match mine, and it seems to allow for scattering into perfectly allowed states.</p>

<p>The second half of the argument is that since the applied field, $H$ tends to <em>align the impurties with the field</em>, there will be more scattering processes like the ones described above ($\downarrow\to\uparrow$) than the opposite ($\uparrow\to\downarrow$).  Why is that?</p>

<p>Is it because there is a reduction of the number of impurities in the state with the lowest possible angular momentum? (i.e. if $S_\text{min}\leq M_s\leq S_\text{max}$, there will be fewer impurities with $M_s=S_\text{min}$ than $M_s=S_\text{max}$).</p>

"275400","How to conceptually and physically explain what is a generator?","<p>The idea of generators of transformations is quite useful and quite simple to formulate from a pure mathematical point of view.</p>

<p>For example, in Hamiltonian Mechanics, we have a configuration manifold $Q$ and the phase space $M=T^\ast Q$ which is just the cotangent bundle. In that case, we know that the Poison Brackets $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ allows us to get a vector field from a function in the following way: given $f\in C^\infty(M)$ we define $X_f$ by</p>

<p>$$X_f g=\{f,g\}.$$</p>

<p>By the properties of $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ it turns out that $X_f$ is a derivation and thus defines a vector field.</p>

<p>But as always, being a vector field $X_f$ defines one system of infinitesimal transformations which, when integrated, gives rise to a full transformation on the phase space. </p>

<p>We then say that $f$ is the generator of the corresponding transformation.</p>

<p>Following this procedure we can easily say that momentum is the generator of translations, angular momentum is the generator of rotations and the Hamiltonian is the generator of time evolution.</p>

<p>This is the Hamiltonian Mechanics picture, but the same can be formulated in Lagrangian Mechanics by the use of Noether's theorem. </p>

<p>Furthremore, all of this can be also done in Quantum Mechanics, dealing now with observables. In truth, Schrödinger's equation just says that the Hamiltonian should be the generator of time evolution as in Hamiltonian Mechanics.</p>

<p>All of that is nice, but IMHO, this all is based on too much math. This is fine, but I think that the grasping the physical understanding behind this is <em>really</em> worthwhile.</p>

<p>So, based on this discussion, when we have a transformation like translations, rotations, time evolution and so forth, what the corresponding generators are from a physical and conceptual standpoint?</p>

<p>If we want to explain what it means to say that momentum is the generator of translations, how can we do so, from a purely conceptual and physical standpoint?</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> believe there is a nice way to understand this idea of generator from a physical standpoint. Something along the lines that: the particle can only undergo a translation because it has momentum. That is: the position can only change because the particle is moving and momentum measures the ""quantity of motion"". But this is yet not very good.</p>

<p>I just want to grasp this physical understanding in a more general way for any generator of any transformation.</p>

In this paper, for example, you can see distortions of the Brillouin zone as a result of a pseudomagnetic potential. There are many papers that do very similar things.</p>

<p>What I have never seen, though (and believe me I have looked), is a justification for looking at such systems in reciprocal space. The most important issue for me is that Bloch's theorem simply doesn't hold under systems with broken translational symmetry. With the pseudomagnetic strain, I guess it is possible to reformulate a version of Bloch's theorem with the present 3-fold rotational symmetry instead, but I'm not convinced that anything useful (or physical) will come out of that.</p>

<p>Next, the systems being simulated are always finite (I'm not convinced it makes much sense for an infinite system to have these kinds of strains). I presume that this should make the Brillouin zone discrete (which would be a shame, because a lot of fun stuff comes out of the continuity of it).</p>

<p>I suppose one could simply look at an individual site $a$ and map the relative positions of all other sites $b$ to ${2\pi}/{\left|r_{a,b}\right|}$ from the origin - this would result in a discretised Brillouin zone that is unique for each site, but this (again) doesn't seem useful.</p>

<p>Another idea is to simply say that a few thousand lattice sites form one unit cell, hammer in some form of artifical translational symmetry, and simply ""zoom in"" to the resulting Brillouin zone, but this raises all kind of alarm bells for me.</p>

"275428","What does it mean to say that ""the fundamental forces of nature were unified""?","<p>It is said that immediately after the Big Bang, the fundamental forces of nature were unified. It is also said that later they decoupled, becoming separate forces.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_of_matter"">list of states of matter</a> on Wikipedia we see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Weakly symmetric matter: for up to $10^{−12}$ seconds after the Big Bang the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces were unified.</p></li>
  <li><p>Strongly symmetric matter: for up to $10^{−36}$ seconds after the Big Bang, the energy density of the universe was so high that the four forces of nature — strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational — are thought to have been unified into one single force. As the universe expanded, the temperature and density dropped and the gravitational force separated, a process called symmetry breaking.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only is it said that the forces were once unified, but this is also somehow related to the states of matter.</p>

<p>I want to understand all of this better. What does it <strong>truly</strong> mean, from a more rigorous standpoint, to say that the forces were unified and later decoupled? How this relate to the states of matter anyway? </p>

"275434","How does an off balance Load affect Direct Drive Dc Motors on a robotic ""vehicle""","<p>I write the autonomous program for my local robotics team. The robot has 4 wheels directly fixed to an Andy Mark motor. there is no leveling or balancing system. due to placement of different modules with in the robot each side is under a different amount of stress due to weight. The off balanced weight causes the robot to drive slightly to the left when it should be driving straight. I believe this can be fixed by Throttling the power(thus Throttling the RPM). so I plan to place a scale under each of the motors (4 at one time) to show the weight that each motor must pull.

"275456","Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a scalar field","<p>In Modern Particle Physics, Thomson explains the symmetry breaking for a scalar field in the following way:</p>

<li><p>The vacuum is given by the lowest level of $V(\phi).$ $\lambda$ must be positive for the potential to have finite minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>This can happen either for $\mu^2&gt;0$ or $\mu^2&lt;0.$ The first implies $V(\phi)$ minimum at $\phi=0$, but in the second case this happens when $$ \phi=\pm v=\pm\left| \sqrt{\frac{-\mu^2}{\lambda^{\prime}}} \right|.$$</p></li>
<li><p>He concludes by saying that ""The choice of the vacuum state [$\pm v$] breaks the symmetry of the Lagrangian, a process known as <em>spontaneous symmetry breaking</em>.""</p></li>
</ol>

"275470","Proper interpretation of $\rho_\textrm{rad} \, a^4$ in cosmology","<p>Radiation fluid is usually represented by the equation of state $p = \frac{1}{3} \, \rho$, where $p$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the energy density.  The local conservation of energy states that
\begin{equation}\tag{1}
\rho_\textrm{rad} = \rho_0 \, \frac{a_0^4}{a^4},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0$ and $a_0$ are constants and $a$ is the <em>cosmological scale factor</em> with units of length.  This is a well known subject in standard cosmology.  What puzzles me is the constant $\rho_0 \, a_0^4$.  What is its rigorous interpretation ?  For cold dust-like matter, it's easy :  $\rho_\textrm{mat} \propto a^{- 3}$ and $M = \rho_0 \, a_0^3$ is interpreted as the conserved <strong><em>total proper mass</em></strong> of matter inside the volume $a^3$.</p>

<p>In case of radiation, energy $E_\textrm{rad} = \rho \, a^3$ is <strong>not conserved</strong>, since there is pressure and the photons wavelength is redshifted while the universe expands.  But then what is the constant $\rho \, a^4$ ?  I strongly suspect it's related to the <strong><em>total radiation entropy</em></strong> in the volume $a^3$, or maybe the <strong><em>number of ultra-relativistic particles</em></strong>, but I can't find any reliable source on this.</p>

<p>I know that in standard RWFL (Robertson-Walker-Friedmann-Lemaître) models, entropy is conserved because of the local conservation of energy-momentum, which is equivalent of saying
\begin{equation}\tag{2}
\mathrm dE = T \, \mathrm dS - p \, \mathrm dV = -\, p \, \mathrm dV.
\end{equation}
I also know that Stefan-Boltzmann law states that $\rho_\textrm{rad} \propto T^4$, and classical radiation entropy is $S \propto T^3 V$ within a volume $V$.  Thus $\rho \, a^4 \propto T^4 \, V^{4/3} \propto S^{4/3}$, which is indeed conserved since entropy doesn't change.  But I'm not totally satisfied by this reasoning and never saw this in my books on General Relativity and cosmology.</p>

<p>Anyone has a convincing argument that this indeed should be true ?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong>  The following is one aspect of the problem that puzzles me.  The thermodynamics argument above gives
\begin{equation}\tag{3}
\rho_\textrm{rad} \, a^4 \propto S^{4/3}.
\end{equation}
The exponent $\frac{4}{3}$ <em>coincides</em> with the adiabatic index $\gamma = \frac{4}{3}$ of the ultra-relativistic gas.  What is it doing here ?  If I introduce the <strong><em>entropy density</em></strong> $\sigma = S/V$, then we could apparently write this :
\begin{equation}\tag{4}
\rho_\textrm{rad} \propto \sigma^{\gamma},
\end{equation}
which recalls the <em>polytropic gaz</em> equation of state $p \propto \rho_\textrm{mass}^{\gamma}$.  Why is that ?  Can this be made more general (for $\gamma \ne \frac{4}{3}$) ?  I never saw the relations (3) and (4) in my thermodynamics books, as far as I can tell.  I need a more rigorous proof of these, and references if possible.</p>

<p>If $\rho \, a^4$ is related to the <em>number of particles</em> instead of entropy, then the polytropic gas state would make more sense, since $p \propto \rho_\textrm{rad} \propto n^\gamma$, where $n = N/V$ is the particles density.</p>

"275528","Can a statically charged object flying in an airplane float?","<p>Lets say you are flying in a plane headed due west at 1000 km/h (278 m/s) with an altitude of 10km.
According to <a href=""http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#igrfwmm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#igrfwmm</a>, at 10km altitude, Earth's magnetic field is about $2*10^{-5}$ Tesla.</p>

<p>Let's say an object has a mass $m$ in kilograms and has a negative charge of magnitude $q$ in Coulombs. In the airplane it would experience a Lorentz force determined by $F=qv \times B$ of about $0.00556*q$ Newtons. This would result in an acceleration (given by $F = m*a$) of $0.00556*\frac{q}{m}$ meters per second squared in an upward direction (negative charges going west in a magnetic field pointing north experience an upward force). The object would also experience a downward acceleration of about $9.8$ meters per second squared.</p>

<p>Therefore if the object had a charge to mass ratio of roughly $$\frac{q}{m}= 1763 \text{ Coulombs per kilogram}$$ then it would float in mid air. So my first observation is that free moving negatively charged ions in the air which have a charge to mass ratio orders of magnitude above this would experience a strong upward force and positively charged ions would experience a strong downward force. This would quickly create an electric field from a positive charge buildup on the bottom of the plane and a negative charge buildup on the top. The electric field would grow until the electric field force (pushing in the opposite direction of the Lorentz force) balanced the Lorentz force.</p>

<p>Therefore, lets say you have the following available to you:</p>

<p>1) An airplane that does not generate an electric field while flying by somehow being built completely from a non conductive material and being filled with a vacuum and somehow generating no static build up from friction with the air outside. This possibly magical airplane is not of central importance to the question so don't focus on it. I just want to provide a vacuum environment with no electric field.</p>

<p>2) A Van de Graaff generator capable of generating very large static charges on objects.</p>

<p>3) Any materials you wish that you think can be charged with a large charge to mass ratio. For example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel"" rel=""nofollow"">Aerogel</a>, copper, aluminum, ceramics, graphene sheets, carbon nanotubes or something else which may be able to hold a lot of charge and be very light. I am guessing that a high surface area to weight ratio is probably the best bet. NOTE: Capacitors will <strong>not</strong> work. Capacitors store a large amount of charge, but it is positive and negative, so the net Lorentz force on a capacitor would be $0$.</p>

<p>If for some strange reason it is easier to place a large positive charge on an object by electron depletion, you are allowed to make the plane fly east and use a Van de Graaff generator which generated positive static charge.</p>

<p>So my question is; With modern materials, is it possible to construct and charge an object like this so that it will float in the airplane?</p>

"275529","Optical system: thin convex lens- bandpass filter-pinhole","<p>I have a thin convex lens, a bandpass filter (BPF) and a pinhole in my setup. The purpose is to catch the light of a laser spot from a far surface ($10~\mathrm{m} - 100~\mathrm{m}$). I use the pinhole in or near the lens focus in order to stop as much as possible the unwanted light around the laser spot. I use the BPF to stop the unwanted wavelengths. After the pinhole, I place a photodiode.
I have two questions:
1. Is the rays must be exactly perpendicular to the BPF ? (I think so but how much? May I place the BPF between the lens and the pinhole?)
2. Given the wavelength (say $900~\mathrm{nm}$), may I use a pinhole of say $10~\mathrm{\mu m}$ ? What about diffraction?</p>

"275530","Number densities at onset of recombination","<p>I have a question considering cosmological hydrogen recombination (i.e. the epoche when the temperature of the Universe drops below ~$13.6~\mathrm{eV}$ and electrons and protons start to combine to form hydrogen atoms.</p>

<p>Apparently, the number densities $n_e$ and $n_p$ of protons and electrons are equal at that epoche because of charge neutrality (since hydrogen recombination only starts after helium is fully neutral).</p>

<p>However, in the book I'm working with it's also stated that recombination starts at a time where the reaction rates of recombination and ionization are high enough to maintain equilibrium, which means that the number densities of electrons, protons and hydrogen are given by the following equation:</p>

<p>$$
n_{i,eq}=g_i\cdot\left(\frac{m_iT}{2\pi}\right)^{3/2}e^{(\mu_i-m_i)/T}
$$</p>

<p>where $i=e,p,H$ and the temperature $T$ is the same for all three species.</p>

<p>So my question is, isn't this a contradiction? The formula above doesn't yield the same number density for both electrons and protons.</p>

<p>Also, I'm confused with the terminology used throughout the early evolution of the Universe... What exactly do we mean with a particle species ""freezes out"", ""decouples"" and ""falls out of thermal equilibrium"" (with the photon fluid)? On some occassions, these notions seem to be used equivalently. On others, they seem to mean different events - for example, the electrons ""freeze-out"" (decouple?) at $T$~$0.51~\mathrm{MeV}$, i.e. when the temperature of the Universe drops below their rest mass, but remain in thermal equilibrium with the photon fluid until electrons ""decouple"" at redshift $z$~$150$ when Compton scattering becomes too inefficient to maintain thermal equilibrium. Also, photons and electrons ""decouple"" at redshift z~1100 (surface of last scattering/origin of the CMB). So in total, there are 3 events which are all refered to with the same terminology (""decoupling of electrons and photons""), which is what confuses me. I hope someone can clarify this notions for me.</p>

He then found the average total energy of all those standing waves by multiplying the possible discrete energies by the weights, using Boltzmann probabilty distribution $P(\epsilon)=\frac{\exp(-\frac{\epsilon}{kT})}{kT}$ and computing the summation to get the Planck's Blackbody distribution.

<p>In the book ""<em>A Treatise on Heat</em>"" by Saha and Srivastava and also in my professor's lecture notes, it states that Planck considered the cavity radiation to be composed of simple harmonic hertzian oscillators and then calculated the number density of those oscillators. He then found the average total energy of all those standing waves by multiplying the possible discrete energies by the weights, using Maxwell probabilty distribution $P(\epsilon)=\exp(-\frac{\epsilon}{kT})$ and computing the same summation to get the Planck's Blackbody distribution.
$$N=\sum_{i=1}^\infty N_i$$ $$\bar E=\frac{1}{N}(N_1\cdot\epsilon+N_2\cdot2\epsilon+\ldots)=\frac{\epsilon}{N}\sum_{r=1}^\infty rN_r$$ $$N_r=N_1\exp(-\frac{\epsilon}{kT})$$
In Kenneth Krane's book on Modern Physics, it states the radiation is composed of resonators and that Planck used the Maxwell-Boltzmann probabilty distribution $P(\epsilon)=\frac{N\exp(-\frac{\epsilon}{kT})}{kT}$ for his corresponding calculations.</p>

The fusion of hydrogen into helium in the Sun's core requires the emission of two positrons per final helium nucleus, because we start off with four protons and end up with two protons and two neutrons confined inside the helium product, and the process therefore needs to get rid of two units of positive charge.</p>

<p>These positrons, of course, are quickly annihilated by two electrons from the environment, squaring the final balance in the books - we take four proton-electron pairs and produce a helium atom with only two electrons.</p>

<p>My question is what, exactly, ""quickly"" means in this situation. The process is probably instantaneous with respect to most physically relevant phenomena (including, for the purposes of the previous question, transport phenomena), but it will have some nonzero timescale (zeptoseconds? nanoseconds? hours?). So: what is the mean lifetime of one of these positrons? Does it depend on conditions such as the ambient temperature and pressure or the positron's energy? Does it change if we go from the Sun to stars of other masses or in other stages of development?</p>

"275578","Obtaining $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$ from first principles derivation","<p>I'm nearly at the end of this derivation but totally stuck so I'd appreciate a nudge in the right direction</p>

<p>Consider a set of N identical but distinguishable particles in a system of energy E. These particles are to be placed in energy levels $E_i$ for $i = 1, 2 .. r$. Assume that we have $n_i$ particles in each energy level. The two constraints we impose are that $\sum_{i}^{r}n_i = N$ and $\sum_{i}^{r}E_i n_i = E$. </p>

<p>The number of microstates in a given macrostate is given by
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{N!}{\sum_{i}^r n_{i}!}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>We want to maximize this and for ease of notation, we work with $\ln\Omega$ and we use Stirling's approximation ($\ln x! = x\ln x - x$) to obtain
\begin{equation}
\ln\Omega = N\ln N - N - \sum_{i}^{r}n_i\ln n_i - n_i
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Maximizing this function subject to the constraints $\sum_{i}^{r}n_i = N$ and $\sum_{i}^{r}E_i n_i = E$ is a classic Lagrange multiplier problem. We represent the undetermined multipliers to be $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for the two constraints and obtain
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\ln\Omega}{\partial n_i} &amp;= \alpha\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial n_i} + \beta\frac{\partial E_i n_i}{\partial n_i} \\ \nonumber
\ln n_i &amp;= \alpha + \beta E_i \\ \nonumber
\therefore n_i &amp;= e^{\alpha}e^{\beta E_i}
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now, we use the first constraint equation to determine $\alpha$. We get
\begin{align}
\sum_i^r n_i &amp;= N \\ \nonumber
\sum_i^r e^{\alpha}e^{\beta E_i} &amp;= N \\ \nonumber
e^\alpha &amp;= \frac{N}{\sum_i^re^{\beta E_i}} \\ \nonumber
e^\alpha &amp;= \frac{N}{Z}
\end{align}</p>

<p>We have introduced the partition function, $Z=\sum_i^re^{\beta E_i}$ in the last line. Next, we have the second constraint equation that determines $\beta$
\begin{align}
\sum_i^r E_i n_i &amp;= E \\ \nonumber
\frac{\sum_{i}^{r} E_i e^{\beta E_i}}{\sum_i^r e^{\beta E_i}} &amp;= E \\ \nonumber
\end{align}</p>

<p>I'm assuming I should somehow connect $E$ with $T$ so let's say $E=Nk_B T$. Then we have 
\begin{align}
\frac{N}{Z}\frac{\partial Z}{\partial\beta} &amp;= E \\
\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial\beta} &amp;= k_B T
\end{align}</p>

<p>How do I get to $\beta = -\frac{1}{k_B T}$ here? Notice that this derivation requires an extra minus sign compared to the usual definition of $\beta$ and this should come out naturally too, shouldn't it?</p>

"275591","Measuring the irradiance due to solar radiation with a pyranometer","<h2>Background information</h2>

<p>I carried out an experiment where a pyranometer (on a flat surface) was used to measure the irradiance at the ground due to solar radiation over a range of solar zenith angles (SZA).</p>

<p>[To be clear, the definition of irradiance is: ""the radiant flux (power) received by a surface per unit area. The SI unit of irradiance is the watt per square metre (W/m^2)"" (<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"" rel=""nofollow"">from Wikipedia</a>)]</p>

<p>The lab script I was given used the formula $$\tau = \frac{I_\lambda}{I_{\lambda 0}} = e^{-u \sec(Z)}$$ where</p>

<ul>
<li>$\tau$ is the transmissivity of the atmosphere</li>
<li>$I_\lambda$ is the ""intensity"" at the surface</li>
<li>$I_{\lambda 0}$ is the ""intensity"" at the top of atmosphere (TOA)</li>
<li>$u$ is the optical depth of the vertical column (see diagram below)</li>
<li>$Z$ is the SZA</li>
<li>thus $u \sec(Z)$ is the optical depth experienced by a ray of sunlight propagating at an angle $Z$ to the vertical</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a form of the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law, then transmissivity is inversely proportional to the exponential of the optical depth, and also equal to the ratio of the irradiance at the start of the path to the irradiance at the end of the path, and I am satisfied this is correct. The diagram below (that I have made) illustrates this law (ignore the lowercase $z$).</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iH8wc.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iH8wc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The lab script (perhaps rather sloppily) uses the word ""intensity"" instead of irradiance, but the demonstrators did agree that we're measuring in watts per square metre.</p>

<h2>The problem (TL;DR version)</h2>

<p>In my analysis, I have used $I_{\lambda 0} = I_{SC} \cos(Z)$, where $I_{SC}$ is the solar constant (~ 1360 W/m^2), as the TOA irradiance.</p>

<p>This has been marked as wrong; apparently I should've used $I_{\lambda 0} = I_{SC}$, but this seems obviously wrong to me.</p>

<p>Who is correct?</p>

<hr>

<h2>The problem (long version)</h2>

<h3>Explanation 1</h3>

<p>As $I_{\lambda 0}$ is the irradiance at the TOA, and irradiance is power per unit area, it changes over the course of a day as the SZA varies, following a cosine law with respect to SZA, but the solar constant is a constant (1360 W/m^2), therefore $I_{\lambda 0} \neq I_{SC}$, instead $I_{\lambda 0} = I_{SC} \cos(Z)$</p>

<h3>Response 1 (from marker A)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kh6V8.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kh6V8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the problem I see with this is that for $I_2$, it seems to assume the pyranometer is facing directly towards the sun, which is incorrect, as the pyranometer was facing vertically upwards (normal to the surface of the planet) in the experiment.</p>

<p>This means $I_2 = \frac{I_\lambda}{\cos(Z)}$, leading to my initial conclusion.</p>

<p>Also the diagram is way out of proportion.</p>

<h3>Explanation 2</h3>

<p>In the case of a very optically thin atmosphere, $u \approx 0$, so our Beer-Lambert law gives $$\frac{I_\lambda}{I_{\lambda 0}} = 1 = const$$</p>

<p>If $I_{\lambda 0} = I_{SC} = const$, as the marker claims, then the expression above would be false, because $I_\lambda$ (the irradiance measured at the ground by the pyranometer) varies with the cosine of the SZA.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to divide the left hand side by $\cos(Z)$ for that expression to be correct/constant.</p>

<h3>Response 2 (from marker B)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pyranometer has a $2\pi$ field of view due to its hemispherical glass dome.</p>
  
  <p>Consider a parallel beam incident on a normal surface, with intensity $F_0$. When the beam is not normal to the surface, the intensity perpendicular to the surface is now reduced and is $F_0 \cos(Z)$. The cosine corrected response of the pyranometer means that the output of the pyranometer is $F_0$ for the case of normal incidence and for the case where the angle is $Z$.</p>
  
  <p>As the pyranometer manual states, this correction is valid up until $Z$ = 80 deg. You have misinterpreted what the manual refers to as a ‘cosine corrected response’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This manual states, ""Ideally a pyranometer has a directional response which is exactly the same as the cosine-law,"" which seems to be in direct contradiction with what he is saying.</p>

<p>Also, he seems to suggest that the output voltage will be identical for any SZA(less than 80 deg) assuming no atmosphere. But the output voltage is proportional to the irradiance in W/m^2 (17.01e-6 V/W/m^2 is printed on the side of the pyranometer). Surely this means the output voltage is proportional to $F_0 \cos(Z)$ if the irradiance is proportional to $F_0 \cos(Z)$?</p>

<p>As for the dome, the explanation of its purpose given in the manual is, “The rise of temperature in the thermopile is easily aﬀected by wind, rain and thermal radiation losses to the environment (for example, a 'cold' sky) and the delicate black coating must be protected. Therefore the detector is shielded by a dome. This dome allows equal transmittance of the direct solar radiation component for every position of the sun in the hemisphere above the detector.”</p>

<p>To me, this indicates that the hemispherical shape is such that the direct beam from the sun is always normal to the dome surface, so no refraction occurs and the transmitted beam carries on straight to the thermopile. But the angle the beam makes with the thermopile still determines the irradiance.</p>

<p>This is the pyranometer used, Kipp &amp; Zonen CMP3</p>

It is connected by a massless string $S$ and perfect spring $k$ (with Hookean spring constant $k$) to mass $m_1$. Pulley $P$ is frictionless. At $t=0$ the spring is not extended at all. Then $m_1$ is released.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>What is the minimum $m_1$ to cause movement of $m_2$ up the incline?</p>

<p><strong>Attempt:</strong></p>

<p>Ignore the spring.</p>

<p>Determine static coefficient $\mu$ first.</p>

<p>\begin{align}m_2g\sin \theta &amp;=\mu m_2g\cos \theta\\ \implies \mu &amp;=\tan \theta\end{align}</p>

<p>To overcome the $m_2g$ component parallel to the inclined and the friction:</p>

<p>\begin{align}m_1g &amp;\gt\mu m_2g\cos \theta+m_2g\sin \theta\\ \implies m_1 &amp;\gt 2m_2\sin \theta\end{align}</p>

<p>But apparently this <em>overestimates</em> $m_1$. It has to be taken into account that $m_1$ starts accelerating before $m_2$ starts moving, <em>because of the spring</em>.</p>

<p><strong>But how?</strong> Like several other members I can't see how the work done on the spring affects the minimum $m_1$. Conservation of energy?</p>

"275619","Are ""gravitational atoms"" stable without quantization?","<p>A motivation to develop the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model"" rel=""nofollow"">Bohr model</a> of the atom was according to Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the Larmor formula), predict that the electron will release electromagnetic radiation while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would rapidly spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus on a timescale of around 16 picoseconds. This atom model is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To overcome this difficulty Bohr had to postulate that electrons don't radiate in orbits where the angular momentum of the electron is a integer multiple of Plancks constant.</p>

<p>Now lets assume we had an atom of neutral particles holding together only by gravity. If a small light particle orbits a much more heavy one, I believe the light particle would follow a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_geodesics"" rel=""nofollow"">Schwarzschild geodesic</a>. But neutral particles following a Schwarzschild geodesic don't seem to loose energy by radiating gravitational waves. So I think, if we had atoms holding together only by gravity, there would be no need to introduce Bohrs postulates and there would be no need to quantize the angular momentum of the orbits. </p>

<p>Is this really true? Would ""gravitational atoms"" be stable without quantization?</p>

"275635","Temperature and particles and fields","<p>When I studied Thermodynamics the way I learned things and the way I understood them is that temperature is a quantity that appears and is relevant just when studying macroscopic matter.</p>

<p>Indeed, all the framework I've learned to deal with temperature was connected to this ""macroscopic matter approach"", so that it all starts with a fundamental relation $U = U(S,X_1,\dots,X_n)$ where $S$ is the entropy and $X_i$ are extensive parameters of the macroscopic system.</p>

<p>In that setting the temperature is:</p>

<p>$$T = \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial S}.$$</p>

<p>So there are some remarks here:</p>

<ol>
<li>$T$ is a function of the parameters describing the macroscopic body;</li>
<li>$T$ is not a function defined pointwise in space;</li>
<li>$T$ only makes sense for a very specific macroscopic body, namely, the one described by the extensive parameters $X_1,\dots,X_n$ and whose fundamental relation is $U = U(S,X_1,\dots,X_n)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even when I studied statistical mechanics everything remained the same, the only difference was that statistical mechanics gave a way to compute $S$ or the other potentials, starting from microscopic considerations.</p>

<p>Now, I've seem some times now some discussions where temperature is involved in phenomena related to fields and particles, like when talking about the big bang and the evolution of the universe after it.</p>

<p>But in this framework I learned it simply doesn't make any sense bringing these things together.</p>

<p>So, how can temperature ever relate to phenomena involving fields and particles, and how do we deal mathematically with temperature in these situations, since, as I said, the traditional framework, just relates temperature to equilibrium states of macroscopic matter?</p>

"275655","Transferring force through a string, including gravity","<p>I couldn't think of a better title to describe this confusion that I have. </p>

<p>Say you pick up a string and pull on both ends so that it is rigid. The string is a collection of an infinite number of objects. For simplicity, assume there are $n$ objects for some large integer $n$, each of which has mass $m$, and number the objects $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_n$ from left to right. Maybe we can take the limit as $n$ goes to infinity; I don't know how to rigorize this. </p>

<p>Your left hand exerts some force $\vec{F}$ onto $A_1$. The only other two forces on $A_1$ are gravity and the force $\vec{F}_{21}$ from $A_2$, since $A_1$ is only in contact with $A_2$. Gravity is $m\vec{g}$. Since the string is not moving, the sum of the forces on $A_1$ is $\vec{0}$, so<br>
$$\vec{F}_{21}+\vec{F}+m\vec{g}=\vec{0}$$
$$\vec{F}_{21}=-\vec{F}-m\vec{g}$$</p>

<p>By Newton's Third Law, the force $\vec{F}_{12}$ from $A_1$ onto $A_2$ equals $-\vec{F}_{21}$, which is $\vec{F}+m\vec{g}$. The only other two forces on $A_2$ are $m\vec{g}$ and the force $\vec{F}_{32}$ from $A_3$ onto $A_2$, so<br>
$$\vec{F}+m\vec{g}+m\vec{g}+\vec{F}_{32}=0$$
$$\vec{F}_{32}=-\vec{F}-2m\vec{g}$$</p>

<p>If we keep going, we add an $m\vec{g}$ each time, until we get that the force from our right hand onto $A_n$ is $-\vec{F}-nm\vec{g}$, which is a lot more than $\vec{F}$, not to mention that $n$ is supposed to go to infinity. </p>

<p>What is wrong with my logic? Do my hands somehow exert $-m\vec{g}$ on each object?</p>

<p>From what I understand, using a simple model for gravity and atmosphere, Mars' lack of atmosphere could be explained by its small escape velocity : even if the surface of the planet is cold, hydrogen and other gases particles had enough energy to escape the planet's gravitational pull.

Every book says that traction vector at a point <strong>P</strong> depends on orientation of surface cutting this point. But as far as I know traction is defined in this way: Traction is force over area it is acting on, so $\vec{T}$ equals $\vec{F}/| \vec{n}|$. In this case traction is a physical vector (not a coordinate vector) and should not depend on anything at all! </p>

<p>Why the hell physical vector depends on orientation of the surface? I guess my problem lies in my miss understanding what a traction vector is, maybe it's a resulatant of all forces acting on a cut sufface. </p>

<p>Please, explain in excruciating details since I've tried like 20 or 30 sources (intoduction to solid dynamics and stuff) and everywhere I've looked authors just say that ""traction depends..."" and no details why <strong>physical vector</strong> all of a sudden depends on something..</p>

<p>Here is a picture in my head:

<p>In it we see a traction vector acting on a point P. Let's make a cut SurfaceH and a cut SurfaceV. So... Traction vector stays the same just the projections on to the different cuts change but not the vector itself.</p>

"275704","Angular trajectory of body moving on rim of a carousel","<p>The question : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A body with a mass $ m $ is moving without friction on the rim of a carousel that has radius $ R $. The carousel is rotating with an angular speed $ \omega (t) = Ae^{-\alpha t} $ where $ A,\alpha &gt; 0 $. Find the angular trajectory $ \Phi (t) $ of the body with respect to a person that rotates with a carousel. Conditions are : $ \Phi (0) = 0$ and $ \dot{\Phi} (t) = 0$.</p>

<p>I suppose that I need to write an equation for a motion :</p>

"275705","What is the physical meaning of Lie dragging?","<p>Wikipedia's article on torsion includes the following excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that an observer is moving along a geodesic, and carries with herself a system of rigid straight measuring rods (a coordinate system). Each rod is a straight segment; a geodesic. Assume that each rod is parallel transported along the trajectory. The fact that these rods are physically carried along the trajectory means that they are Lie-dragged, or propagated so that the Lie derivative of each rod along the tangent vanishes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand the last sentence, which seems to equate Lie dragging with physically dragging an object. That's certainly a nice physical interpretation for something I thought was just a mathematical tool, but I can't see how Lie dragging is even relevant here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is Lie dragging needed to describe what happens when you hold a ruler? Isn't that just parallel transport of the vector pointing along the ruler?</li>
<li>Along what vector field are we doing the Lie dragging? Isn't there only one vector around, the observer's velocity?</li>

"275723","Laws of dynamics and reference frame","<p>I was having trouble understanding the following text given in my mechanics textbook:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we choose an arbitrary set of frames of reference which are all in uniform rectilinear motion relative to each other and if. in addition, it is known that the laws of dynamics hold for one of these frames then the first and the second laws of dynamics are stated in the same manner for all the frames of reference we have chosen. All such frames are referred to as <strong>inertial</strong>(Galilean) frames of reference and the Galilean inertial law is valid only for such frames. This is the proposition we call Galileo's relativity principle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the above definition of inertial frames of reference the frames of reference need to be moving uniformly w.r.t each other, this doesn't limit them from moving with some acceleration given that all have the same acceleration. Then, there is the part where the book mentions that the third law of dynamics need not be stated in the same way for all the frames of reference, indicating that they can be accelerated w.r.t an inertial frame of reference . Also, according to the definition of inertial frame in the book which is as follows:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The investigation of motions whose velocities are small in comparison with the velocity of light indicates that coordinate system whose origin is connected with the center of mass of the bodies forming the Solar System  and whose axes have invariable direction relative to the fixed stars can be taken as an inertial frame of reference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find the two definitions to be rather conflicting as one says that no external force should be acting on the inertial frame or rather it should be in a position of rest, while the other says that it can have some acceleration. So, which one is correct, or is it me interpreting the whole thing incorrectly.</p>

"275732","does object sink in water in absence of third medium like air?","<p>I challenged my friend about the following:</p>

<p>I told him if we filled a bottle with water and we put a stone inside of it with condition no existence of air bobbles in the bottle, I told him the stone and water will become one model and the stone will not sink if you flip the bottle, while my friend says that the stone will flip due to the gravity.</p>

<p>My concern is by making the bottle without air inside, so the stone and the water will have enough pressure to make this bottle + water + stone as one object and all as one modal.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking aloud</strong></p>

<p>in a non gravitational force (external on the bottle), the only working forces are the particles towards each others ( same as the stone it self and its molecules) + (water and its molecules), the water will apply force towards the stone and also the stone towards the water. ( there will be a binding energy between the water and the stone).</p>

<p>so, based on the universal gravitation equation the force of gravity will be very high since there is no distance between water and stone and both will form one system. </p>

<p>if we flip the bottle, as if the bottle is rotating around an axis, the facts about this rotating object are</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no centripetal force since the space is a non gravitational</li>
<li>There is kinetic energy due to the rotation of the body</li>
<li>There is no moment of inertia , angular momentum, Torque, since the distance between the axis and the object is zero.</li>

<p>As you can see $E_p$ is minimal when $F=0$. However potentially energy (as I know it) is given by $E_p = -\int \vec{F}.d\vec{r}$. So if F=0 this multiplication should clearly result in 0, but it doesn't. Why?</p>

<p>PS: follow-up question: knowing that $\frac{-dU}{dx} = F(x)$. I cannot see this relationship between the two graphs,i.e. completely on the left of the $E_p$,r - graph, you can clearly see the curve has a negative slope. Meaning the derivative should be negative, however this is not what is being shown on the lower graph. The only ""correct"" thing I see is that when the slope of the upper graph is 0 (at $r_0$)the derivative indicates that correctly.</p>

"275762","Adding a small perturbation to a uniform density region","<p>Suppose some region with uniform mass density $\rho$. Suppose a sphere with radius $R$ (can vary with time) and uniform density $\rho(1+\delta)$, $|\delta| \ll 1$ is placed in this region ($\delta = \delta(t)$). Using Newtonian gravity, we get an equation for the radius of the sphere (ignoring pressure)
$$
\frac{\ddot{R}}{R} = -\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}\delta(t)
$$</p>

<p>A result immediately follows that if $\delta &gt; 0$, the sphere contracts, and if $\delta &lt; 0$ the sphere expands. Why, physically, an expanding sphere makes sense if the density of the sphere is less than the uniform density of the region it is in? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Assume the region infinitely big, with uniform density, and suppose the sphere is at the origin. For a point on the sphere, $\vec{r} = R\hat{r}$. From Gauss's law, that point experiences only the gravitational field from mass inside the sphere, that is $\Delta M = \delta\rho$. Assuming the sphere exerts no pressure, we get that
$$
\ddot{R} = -\frac{G\Delta M}{R^2} = -\frac{G\delta\rho}{R^2}\frac{4\pi R^3}{3} = -\frac{4\pi G\rho R}{3}\delta

"275779","Purcell effect in the non-dispersive regime: atom in a cavity for moderate $\Delta$","<p>The system of interest is a two level system placed inside a cavity. This can be an atom and a three dimensional cavity, a superconducting qubit and a coplanar waveguide resonator, but the details do not matter. We will simply assume that we have a two level atom coupled to a cavity and write the Hamiltonian as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H/\hbar} = \frac{\omega_a}{2} \hat{\sigma_z}+ \omega_r \hat{ a}^\dagger \hat{a} + g\left(\hat\sigma^+\hat{a} + \hat a \hat\sigma^-  \right)
\end{equation}
which is just the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian for a two level system coupled to a cavity. </p>

<p>In 1946 E. Purcell derived that when such a two level system is placed inside the cavity (as we have done above), it has an altered spontaneous emission rate $\Gamma_{1a}$, where the $a$ is used to denote that we are talking about the two level system<a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.69.674.2"" rel=""nofollow"">[1]</a>. It is known as the Purcell effect, and it has been observed in a few different systems such as electrical circuits (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7160/full/nature06126.html"" rel=""nofollow"">[2]</a>, arXiv at <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0702648"" rel=""nofollow"">[3]</a>), and most interestingly for me also in transmon qubits coupled to coplanar waveguide resonators (<a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042319"" rel=""nofollow"">[4]</a>, arXiv at <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703002"" rel=""nofollow"">[5]</a>). </p>

<p>What I found in literature <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7160/full/nature06126.html"" rel=""nofollow"">[2]</a> is that there are two main regimes for this: the first is that the cavity is resonant with the atom, in which case they hybridize into two states with $\Gamma_{1\{r,a\}}^{'} = \frac{\Gamma_{1r}+\Gamma_{1a}}{2}$ where I used the prime to differentiate the bare loss rates and the effective loss rates due to the interaction of the two systems. The second scenario is the so called dispersive regime, in which $\Delta^2 = \left|\omega_r-\omega_a \right|^2 \gg g^2$, for which one has that \begin{equation}
\Gamma_{1a}^{'} \approx [1-\left(\frac{g}{\Delta}\right)^2]\Gamma_{1a} + \left(\frac{g}{\Delta}\right)^2\Gamma_{1r}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>My question is now how one can find an expression for $\Gamma_{1a}^{'}$ in the intermediate regime; between the dispersive part and the fully hybridized part. The paper by Koch et al. <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042319"" rel=""nofollow"">[4]</a> writes something about this in section IV B, noting that one can use Fermi's golden rule, but I don't feel as if the way it is phrased there can be used for a full expression. Similarly <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7160/full/nature06126.html"" rel=""nofollow"">[2]</a> shows a theoretical curve in figure 2b, but contains no reference to how it is computed.</p>

<p>So that is what my question comes down to; given the situation sketched above, knowing all of the parameters defined, how do I compute $\Gamma_{1a}^{'}(\Delta)$ for arbitrary detuning $\Delta$? I understand that one might do this numerically rather than with a nice analytic equation; that is fine by me.</p>

<p>Finally, if it helps I can give some orders of magnitude for the quantities in question. Let us take $\Delta = [0 - 400]$ MHz/2$\pi$, $g = 80$ MHz/2$\pi$, $\Gamma_{1a} = 60$ MHz/2$\pi$ and $\Gamma_{1r} = 1$ MHz/2$\pi$. It's just an estimate of the scenario I am interested in, it shouldn't matter for the problem.</p>

"275787","On the difference between electromagnets and permanent magnets","<p>I've been reading about the difference between electromagnets and permanent magnets and I have a question about the difference between them. If permanent magnets get their magnetic field from the spin of their constituent electrons, isn't this spin still present in the case of electromagnets, since electrons everywhere have their own spin? So, does the difference then lie in the type of material being used, whether its hard or soft metal? Otherwise, electrons exist in both of them so we have electron spin in both cases. What I mean is that it's not reasonable to differentiate between them by the electron spin since both have it.</p>

"275789","Schrödinger equation for a central potential","<p>I know that, for a central potential $U(r,\theta, \varphi)=U(r)$, the Schrödinger equation takes the well-known form in spherical coordinates.
I'm searching for separable solutions in the form:
\begin{equation}
\phi(r, \theta,\varphi)=a(r)b(\theta)c(\varphi)
\end{equation}
So, if I understood correctly the theory (I'm a beginner in theoretical physics so maybe I did some conceptual mistakes) my $\phi$ is the eigenfunction corresponding to some eigenvalue E.
Solving the various steps this equation appears for $c(\varphi)$:
\begin{gather}
\frac{d^2c}{d\varphi^2}+m_l^2=0
\end{gather}
And the solution should be:
\begin{equation}
c(\varphi)_{m_l}=Ae^{im_l\varphi}+Be^{-im_l\varphi}
\end{equation}
and after some considerations on the periodicity of $\varphi$, I got that $m_l$ is integer. My problem is the following:</p>

<p>My teacher, and also the majority of the documents I found online, states that the solution is
\begin{equation}
c(\varphi)_{m_l}=Ae^{im_l\varphi}
\end{equation}
saying ""noting that $m_l$ and $-m_l$ yield the same general solution $c(\varphi)$"". What does it mean? Every solution to the harmonic oscillator differential equation yield a solution of the same form, so what is the point? It seems to me that we are ""throwing away"" something (even if I'm sure it's not like this, but I don't understand why).
This is because I think that the equation 
$$\phi(r, \theta,\varphi)_{m_l}=a(r)b(\theta)c(\varphi)_{m_l}$$
would be different if I use $c(\varphi)_{m_l}=Ae^{im_l\varphi}+Be^{-im_l\varphi}$ from the one obtained by using $c(\varphi)_{m_l}=Ae^{im_l\varphi}$.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm missing something really stupid here but I'm in a loop now and I can't see a solution.</p>

"275799","Why is the eye of a cyclone a forced vortex?","<p>As far as I understand, a forced vortex has a velocity profile $u \propto r$ ($r$ is radial distance from centre of vortex), concluding at some outer boundary $r=R$ to avoid fluid particles travellingat infinite speed. At this outer boundary it requires an external torque to be constantly supplied to keep going. For example, the vortex formed when a cylinder with fluid inside is rotated up to some constant angular velocity is a forced vortex; the cylinder needs to be supplied with a constant torque so its rotation does not slow down from shear stress from the fluid.  </p>

"275822","solving a two body problem using relative motion and reduced mass","<p>I'm having a hard time trying to understand fully this topic and how reduced mass and relative velocity should be used. Let's say we have some sort of mechanical problem regarding the interaction (or just the motion) of two bodies (I'm trying to be the most general possible). For instance we could have a problem of gravitation, or a problem where the two masses are held together by a massless rod while moving in absence of external forces. </p>

<p>So, for example, if I were to calculate the angular momentum ($L$) of my system, I would do that by summing the angular momentum of the center of mass ($CM$) and the angular momentum in the $CM$ frame. The former is easy to do, the problem is the latter. I know that while putting  myself in the $CM$ frame the only thing that gives me an angular momentum is the rotational motion of the two masses. Then I know that $\vec{L}=\mu \vec{v}\times \vec{r}= \mu \vec{r} \times (\dot{r} \hat{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\hat{e}_{\theta})$, where $\mu$ is the reduced mass and $v$ the relatice velocity. 
And here it is the problem. First of all, WHY does it work? I mean, not only for the angular momentum, but also for calculating the kinetic energy, the effective potential, also for calculating (if I'm not wrong) the total momentum in the frame of the $CM$. So my question is : why does it work? How can your problem be reduced to another problem where we have just one body with the mass equals to $\mu$ and $v$ speed? Also, in the previous formula, I have used a $\theta$, but I really cannot imagine what his meaning is. When considering two different bodies it's all easier to grasp, but in this situation what angle does that $\theta$ refer to? What's his meaning?

"275830","1+1d TSC as $Z_2^f $ symmetry breaking topological order?","<p>I have been struggling recently with a comprehensive problem on the relationship between topological superconductor and topological order. My question originates from reading a work conducted by Prof. Wen <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5985"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5985</a> ,also a previous answered question <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/71351/do-topological-superconductors-exhibit-symmetry-enriched-topological-order/74821#74821"">Do topological superconductors exhibit symmetry-enriched topological order?</a> ,in which Prof. Wen's comment also deals a lot with my questions presented below.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that 1+1d topological superconductor is a case of 1+1d fermionic topological order (or more strictlly speaking, a symmetry-enriched topological order).</p>

<p>My understanding on topological order is that it is characterized by topological degeneracy, which is degenrate ground states roubust to any local perturbation. And in the paper 1412.5985, it is argued that 1+1d topological superconductor is such a fermionic topological order with fermion-parity $Z_2^f$ symmetry breaking. So far I have learned about one-dimensional (or maybe it's quasi-one-dimensional as you like) topological superconductor, the first case where we have detected the appearance of Majorana zero modes is 1d D-class topological superconductor. And the terminology on D-class is defined from a classification working with BdG symmetry class of Hamiltonian. And D-class means such 1d superconductor possesses only particle-hole symmetry (PHS: $\Xi^2=+1$), and based on Kitaev's K-theory jobs the topological invatiant is $\mathbb{Z}_2$. In non-trivial topological phase labeled with topological number $\nu=-1$, a Majorana zero mode appears at each end of 1d D-class topological superconductor. And under my comprehension, the two Majorana zero modes form a two-fold degenracte ground states $|0\rangle$,$|1\rangle$ with different fermion-parity, and in a fermionic system like superconductor, the Hamiltonian has a fermion-parity $Z_2^f$ symmetry, hence the actual ground state configuration just don't have such symmetry from Hamiltonian and therefore spontaneous breaks it.</p>

<p>However why it should be claimed that such $Z_2^f$ breaking just directly leads to the appearance of 1d fermionic topological order in this 1d topological superconductor? (Regarding to the original words in the paper ""two-fold topological degeneracy is nothing but the 
two-fold degeneracy of the $Z_2^f$ symmetry breaking""). And Prof. Wen in that previous posted question also said that this kind of 1d fermionic topological order state is therefore the result of long-range entanglement(LRE), so Majorana chain is indeed LRE and Kitaev has just used another way with out local unitary transformation definition(LU) to describe topological order. So I want ask how should one treat such open-line 1d Majorana chain as a long-range entanglement quantum state? And what about describing it with LU definition? How should people be supposed to demonstrate that?</p>

<p>And the last but also the most important question which makes me quite confused is that, it seems like all 1d topological superconductors, regardless of what class or what symmetry they have, are 1d fermionic topological order state due to the appearance of topological degeneracy, which so far in here considered as Majorana zero modes. Well, at least in the paper mentioned above, it is about a two-fold topological degeneracy. And in 1d D-class topological superconductor, it is toplogical robust to what perturbation ? It has no TRS, nor chiral symmetry at all. I don't know how to discuss the TRS breaking influence on this two-fold degeneracy. And fine, I assume it is indeed robust to any local perturbation. Then let's consider another case, the 1d DIII-class topological superconductor with TRS $\Theta^2=-1$, and according to Kramer's theorem, each end has a pair of time-reverse counterpart of Majorana zero modes, i.e. Majorana doublet, which forms a four-fold degenracy. After we introduce TRS-breaking perturbation e.g. Zeeman field, the Majorana doublet is lifted and splits a finite energy level-------I have read the references <strong>PhysRevB.88.214514</strong> as well as <strong>PhysRevLett.111.056402</strong> , and I don't know whether I have got it correctly or not. So in these works, I found words claim that such four-fold degenracy is TRS topological protected. Does that imply this kind of 1d toplogical superconductor has actually no topological degenracy with Majorana zero modes since it needs symmetry protection and therefore should belongs to SPT rather then SET ? If it is a yes, then does it mean not all 1d topological superconductors are topological order but just those with two-fold degenarcy may belong to topological order ? If not, then where did I actually get wrong ?</p>

<p>I'd appreciate every helpful comments and replys. Thank you.</p>

"275871","Are there arguments for the form of the Lagrangian in classical mechanics?","<p>Consider some sort of entity/object with generalized coordinate $q$ and generalized velocity $\dot{q}$. Now suppose that we know the form of the object's Lagrangian when it's in free motion, not interacting with anything. Denote that by $\mathcal{L}_{free}$. Now we create conditions for the object to interact with its surroundings, and the Lagrangian becomes $\mathcal{L}$. In classical mechanics, and even in electrodynamics, we have that $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{free}-U$, where $U$ is a function of the generalized position, velocity and time that's usually called the potential, and its form depends <em>only</em> on the type of interaction. Okay. But <strong><em>why</em></strong>?<br>
Can we reach that conclusion without starting from the equations of motion (i.e. Newton's Second Law)? That we can always describe interactions by adding some sort of extra term to the Lagrangian of free motion?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: I've fiddled around with the concept a bit, and started to think about lagrangian multipliers; describing interactions as some sort of constraint $f=0$, and finding stationary points for the free action, $$S_{free}=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathcal{L}_{free}\,\mathrm{d}t$$ subject to the constraint $f=0$, which is equivalent to finding the stationary points of a new functional $$S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathcal{L}_{free}\,\mathrm{d}t-\lambda f=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathcal{L}_{free}-U\,\mathrm{d}t$$ where $U\equiv -\lambda\frac{df}{dt}$, and so we define a new Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{free}-U$.</p>

<p>But this still isn't satisfactory, given that I had to assume that the free action is still 'stationary' despite knowing nothing about how interactions may affect that original Lagrangian. Any ideas? </p>

To support the shelf, I am using two drywall anchors, which each are rated at 50 lbs. If each anchor is placed on one end of the shelf, does that mean that two mounts could support 100 lbs together?</p>

<p>Here's a more detailed example. If my shelf is 1.10 m long, then each drywall anchor is placed 0.05 m from the end (so the distance between the anchors is 1 m exactly). If the anchors are rated to support 50 lbs each, and the shelf weighs 5 lbs, would I be able to place a 95 lb object in the middle of the shelf? Essentially, I am wondering if I can approximate the 'upward-pointing' support forces of the two dry-wall anchors as one force, to counteract the downward force of 100 lbs (shelf plus object). Does the distance between the anchors affect how much weight can be on the shelf?</p>

What if the two drywall anchors were placed directly on to of each other in the exact middle of the beam (I know this is not technically possible, but assume for this instance that this can be done)? Would that change how much the weight the system can support?</p>

"275889","Unitary evolution even after tracing out degrees of freedom","<p>In quantum mechanics it is usually the case that when degrees of freedom in a system are traced out (i.e. ignored), the evolution of the remaining system is no longer unitary and this is formally described as the entropy of the reduced density matrix ($S = Tr(\rho\ln{\rho}$)) attaining a nonzero value.  </p>

<p>Why is it then that there exist certain quantum mechanical systems which have unitary evolution, but for which we clearly do not keep track of all degrees of freedom?  Practically any non-relativistic quantum system such as atomic structure, spin chains, any implementation of a quantum computer etc. are clearly just effective theories which ignore the massive number of degrees of freedom underlying the more fundamental physics, i.e. quantum field theory.  But somehow we are able to trace away all of this underlying physics into an effective potential/interaction term in a Hamiltonian and thus retain unitarity.    </p>

<p>Now this does not work entirely for all systems, particularly it is impossible to hide away the full coupling of an atom to the EM field because you have spontaneous emission, a non-unitary effect.  But still a large part of the electron/proton interaction (which is really mediated through the EM field) can be captured by the Coulomb potential, which ignores the EM field yet is still unitary.  On the other hand, some systems, such as certain implementations of quantum computing/simulation claim to be able to achieve perfect unitarity and are only limited by imperfections in the system.  At least, I have never heard of anyone talking about intrinsic unitarity limitations to a quantum computer.  </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>-Under what conditions can underlying degrees of freedom be hidden away into a unitary interaction?</p>

<p>-Are there intrinsic limits to unitarity of any quantum system (such as an atom's unitarity being limited by spon. emission), assuming that you will always trace out a portion of the underlying field theory?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for exclusively filtering intense coherent laser light while leaving
  the incoherent light background untouched?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Han-Kwang Nienhuys , the experimental physicist states that ""If you want to protect a pilot against the most common high-power laser pointers (532 nm wavelength), you should be using dielectric mirrors as filters. Such mirrors have a coating that is a stack of thin layers, tuned to reflect light of a certain wavelength.
   The dielectric mirror can be designed to reflect only over a very narrow wavelength range, in which case they are called ""notch filter"". You can buy these off the shelf, for example Edmunds OD4 notch filter. A disadvantage for pilot protection is that the reflecting wavelength will depend on the angle of incidence αα. The only way to make them reflect 532 nm wavelength over a wide range of angles is by making them reflect over a large range of wavelengths. If you do that for green light, you will probably end up with something resembling very dark sunglasses, which only transmit deep red and deep blue light and block orange-yellow-green-cyan.""</p>

<p>So another design criterion for the hypothetical tunable filter is insensitivity to large angles of incidence. It has been observed that large angles of incidence map to significant shifts in the center wavelength of the filter. What is the reason for this phenomena?</p>

<p>If so, how might one design such a thing? </p>

<p>There may be too much hoopala made today about the difference between coherent and incoherent light. If the source is fairly small (like sun, as it is very large but also at very large angle hence it is very small) , it will act as spatially coherent source. If you select a very small bandwidth it is also temporally coherent. Hence, one  could stop worrying about coherent/incoherent thing.</p>

<p>The incoherent light form a background and the coherent light is a delta function riding over the background. If we have a narrow band reject filter(say 10 nanometers) could I exclusively remove the intense laser light without losing incoherent light visibility appreciably?</p>

<p>Please feel free to use formulas or drawings if you would like.</p>

<p>I spoke with the Edmund Optics application engineers in the United Kingdom this morning and asked how to exclusively remove red laser pointer light while letting red airport night runway light through untouched. The Edmund Optics application engineer stated that the spectral linewidth of incoherent red night
runway lights is about 100 nanometers wide (50 nm FWHM) while the spectral linewidth of a red coherent laser pointer is about 2 to 3 nanometer. So , the Edmund Optics engineer recommended using either a custom notch matched filter with 2.5 nanometer FWHM similar to part number OD-86121 or an off-the-shelf notch filter with 25 nanometer FWHM. The off-the-shelf notch filter is less costly than the custom notch filter and is capable of blocking the variety of red laser pointers with slightly different center wavelengths.</p>

<p>The spectral linewidth is the first derivative of the optical bandwidth defined as 2 * pi * speed of light divided by center wavelength in nanometers.</p>

<p>Here is a proposed way to fix the weakness of Airbus and Nova Scotia's Metamaterials Inc.s Lambda Guard product where the only way to make them reflect 532 nm wavelength over a wide range of incidence angles is by making them reflect over a large range of center wavelengths because of the optical path length differences. One could design an array of 5 interferometers spanning 0 degrees of angle of incidence to 45 degrees of angle of incidence in 9 degree wide increments.</p>

<p>[EDIT 8/27/2016 11:46 AM Frank] The only way such an array would fix the weakness of Metamaterials Inc.s Lambda Guard product with regard to large incidence angles is to identify probable narrower angle ranges as I did in my volume of vulnerability analysis for the Boeing 767 which I will show here by Sunday evening August 28 2016,  If I made the array wide band(0 degrees to 45 degrees) we would lose the transmission over all wavelengths hence defying our purpose. </p>

<p>Also , Metamaterials Inc.s Lambda Guard product may not be tunable with respect to wavelength causing it to be unresponsive to future frequency agile laser pointer threats.</p>

<p>I hope to show a drawing for this by tonight.    </p>

<p>Now, how does this increase in velocity relate to Bernoulli's Law, where increase in velocity should be associated with increase in dynamic pressure. If so, static pressure would drop and so would the temperature (ideal gas law)?</p>

<p>Indeed, if one considers a frame of reference in which only an electric (or magnetic) field is observed, then, upon a Lorentz transformation to another frame of reference, it is found that one will observe a combination of electric and magnetic fields.

  <p>Stellar models indicate that red dwarfs less than 0.35 M☉ are fully convective.[3] Hence the helium produced by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen is constantly remixed throughout the star, avoiding its buildup at the core and prolonging the period of fusion. Red dwarfs therefore develop very slowly, maintaining a constant luminosity and spectral type for trillions of years, until their fuel is depleted. Because of the comparatively short age of the universe, no red dwarfs exist at advanced stages of evolution. - Wikipedia</p>

"275950","Uniqueness theorem in uniform electric field","<p>Consider the following: 
An uncharged metal sphere of radius $R$ placed in a uniform electric field $\vec{E} = E_0 \hat{z}$. The field will push positive charge to the
northern surface of the sphere, and symmetrically negative charge to the
southern surface. This induced charge, in turn, distorts the field in
the neighborhood of the sphere. Find the potential in the region outside the sphere.</p>

<p>The sphere is an equipotential we can set it to zero. Then by symmtery the entire $xy$ plane is at potential zero. Then $V$ does not go to zero but rather far from the sphere the field is $E_0 \hat{z}$ we thus have $$v \to -E_0z + C.$$ </p>

<p>Since $V = 0$ in the equatorial plane, the constant $C$ must be zero. Then the boundary condition are $$V=0~~~\text{when }r=R \\

"275953","Accounting for work in an irreversible thermodynamic process","<p>I'd like to understand whether a work interaction occurs during the thermodynamic process described below, and why or why not. My analysis seems to suggest that some sort of work should be occurring, but my intuition says there's no work done. So specifically I want to know where my approach fails, or why my intuition is off base.</p>

<p>Consider two equal volumes of an ideal gas, $A$ and $B$, separated by a fixed adiabatic wall. Both halves contain the same number of molecules: The only difference between the two halves is that they're at different temperatures, say $T_A$ and $T_B$. This is the initial equilibrium state of the system.</p>

<p>Now, suppose the adiabatic wall is replaced by a thermally conductive wall, also rigid. This wall keeps the volume of each half the same, but allows energy transfer between the two halves. After some time, the two halves reach a common temperature $(T_A+T_B)/2$.</p>

<p>I can say a few things about this process. Let's just focus on one half of the system, say $A$. First, assuming that the movement towards equilibrium after initial thermal contact is sufficiently slow, the subsystem $A$ passes through a succession of states with roughly well-defined thermodynamic variables. So, at every infinitesimal step of the process, we have:</p>

<p>$$dU=TdS-PdV,$$</p>

<p>where $U$, $T$, $S$, $P$, and $V$ are thermodynamic properties of $A$ alone. Second, by the first law of thermodynamics:</p>

<p>$$dU=\delta Q + \delta W.$$</p>

<p>Here, I've used the convention that $\delta Q$ is the heat flow <em>into</em> $A$ during the infinitesimal step, and $\delta W$ is the work done <em>on</em> A. Taking the difference between these two equations yields:</p>

<p>$$TdS - \delta Q = PdV + \delta W.$$</p>

<p>Now, it seems to me that the process is irreversible: Returning the total system $A$ and $B$ to its original state would require some sort of permanent alteration of its environment. We can't just make the temperatures of the two halves unequal again without any external effects (right? This is one part where I'm a little confused, so I'm being somewhat imprecise). So by the second law of thermodynamics, we know that $dS &gt; \delta Q/T$, and so:</p>

<p>$$TdS - \delta Q = PdV + \delta W &gt; 0.$$</p>

<p>But the volume of $A$ remains fixed during the process, so $dV=0$, and therefore we have $\delta W &gt; 0$. So it seems like at each infinitesimal step in the process, some work is done on $A$. But I can't see a mechanism by which this work is being performed. So am I wrong in my conclusion that a work interaction is occurring, or I am not thinking about something else in the right way?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"275991","Transition probabilities for spin states upon measurement along a rotated axis","<blockquote>
  <p>For a (massive) spin-$n/2$ particle in a particular spin state along the $z$-axis (i.e. for a particular $m$, $m = +n/2, +n/2-1, \cdots, -n/2+1, -n/2$), what is the probability of measuring the particle in another spin state $m'$ along an axis an angle $\theta$ from the $z$-axis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is readily done for spin $1/2$, but I'm interested in generalizing this result to arbitrary spin. I started by constructing the spin matrix $\hat{\sigma}_n$ associated with the axis <strong>n</strong> and solving for the eigenspinors with eigenvalues $+n, +n-1, \cdots, -n+1, -n$. [I work with $\hat{\sigma}_n$ instead of $\hat{s}_n = (\hbar/2)\hat{\sigma}_n$ so I can suppress $\hbar/2$ from popping up everywhere.] Then we can find the relevant probabilities by taking the squared norm of each component of each eigenspinor.</p>

<hr>

<p>For a concrete example, let's work with spin $1$. Then $$\hat{\sigma}_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \hat{\sigma}_y = -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \hat{\sigma}_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}.$$ Taking linear combinations to form $\hat{\sigma}_n = \sin\theta\cos\phi\,\hat{\sigma}_x + \sin\theta\sin\phi\,\hat{\sigma}_y + \cos\theta\,\hat{\sigma}_z$, we obtain
$$\hat{\sigma}_n = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; e^{-i\phi}\sin\theta/\sqrt{2} &amp; 0 \\ e^{i\phi}\sin\theta/\sqrt{2} &amp; 0 &amp; e^{-i\phi}\sin\theta/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 &amp; e^{i\phi}\sin\theta/\sqrt{2} &amp; -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.$$
We now solve the eigenvalue equation $\hat{\sigma}_n |{+n}\rangle = |{+n}\rangle$ for the particular eigenstate $|{+n}\rangle$ with eigenvalue 1, obtaining $$|{+n}\rangle = c_-\begin{bmatrix} e^{-2i\phi}(1+\cos\theta)/(1-\cos\theta) \\ \sqrt{2}(1+\cos\theta)/(e^{i\phi}\sin\theta) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = c_-\begin{bmatrix} e^{-2i\phi}\cot^2(\theta/2) \\ \sqrt{2}e^{-i\phi}\cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\phi}\cos^2(\theta/2) \\ \sqrt{2}\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2) \\ e^{i\phi}\sin^2(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},$$ where in the last step we impose normality on $|{+n}\rangle$ to solve for $c_-$, $$c_- = \frac{e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{\cot^4\theta/2+2\cot^2\theta/2+1}} = \frac{e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{(\cot^2\theta/2+1)^2}} = \frac{e^{i\phi}}{\csc^2\theta/2} = e^{i\phi}\sin^2\theta/2,$$ further choosing the phase factor $e^{i\phi}$ for symmetry.</p>

<p>Hence we see that the probability of measuring a spin-$1$ particle with initial spin state $m=1$ and final spin state $m=1,0,-1$ is $\cos^4(\theta/2), 2\sin^2(\theta/2)\cos^2(\theta/2), \sin^4(\theta/2)$ respectively.</p>

<hr>

<p>Repeating this calculation for other eigenvalues, I found the transition probabilities for small $n$ in matrix form:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VafGj.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VafGj.png"" alt=""transition probabilities in matrix form""></a></p>

<p>The calculations got rather hairy, and with my limited Mathematica skills I haven't even been able to complete the matrix for the spin-$5/2$ case, as you can see---everything inside the border for that case is just speculation.</p>

<p>However, inspection of the border led to a pretty interesting result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a massive spin-$n/2$ particle, the eigenstate $|{+n}\rangle$ of $\hat{\sigma}_n$ with eigenvalue $n$ is given by $$\left\langle \exp{\left(\frac{i(-n)\phi}{2}\right)}\cos^n\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),\dotsc, \sqrt{\binom{n}{n-r}}\exp{\left(\frac{i(2r-n)\phi}{2}\right)}\cos^{n-r}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\sin^r\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),\dotsc,\exp{\left(\frac{in\phi}{2}\right)}\sin^n\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right\rangle,$$ where $r = 0, \dotsc, n$; and $[\cos^2(\theta/2)+\sin^2(\theta/2)]^n$ is the generating function for the probabilities $P(s,\theta)$ of measuring a certain spin angular momentum $s$ at an angle $\theta$ from the spin axis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can (tediously) show that that is indeed an eigenstate by verifying that the eigenvalue equation holds for the general spin operator $$\begin{bmatrix} n\cos\theta &amp; \alpha e^{-i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ \alpha e^{i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; (n-2)\cos\theta &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \rho e^{-i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; \rho e^{i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; (n-2r)\cos\theta &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \psi e^{-i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \psi e^{i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; (2-n)\cos\theta &amp; \omega e^{-i\phi}\sin\theta \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \omega e^{i\phi}\sin\theta &amp; -n\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$$ where all unmarked regions are $0$, and the Greek letters besides $\theta$ and $\phi$ denote raising-operator coefficients given by $\rho = \sqrt{r(n-r+1)}$, and the value of $r$ used is that of the element in the lower diagonal.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then I graphed my results, and they too seemed rather interesting:

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AoXXa.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AoXXa.jpg"" alt=""Square leg configuration""></a>
\begin{eqnarray}
P_1 &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{y_w-y_b}{y_f-y_b}\right)\left(\frac{x_w-x_l}{x_r-x_l}\right) \\
P_2 &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{y_w-y_b}{y_f-y_b}\right)\left(\frac{x_w-x_r}{x_l-x_r}\right) \\
P_3 &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{y_w-y_f}{y_b-y_f}\right)\left(\frac{x_w-x_r}{x_l-x_r}\right) \\
P_4 &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{y_w-y_f}{y_b-y_f}\right)\left(\frac{x_w-x_l}{x_r-x_l}\right) \end{eqnarray}
Here is my question.  The above solution is only good for a square leg configuration.</p>

<p>Can this method be modified to work for a trapezoidal leg configuration, like this?

Better yet, can this method be modified to work for any leg configuration?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong></p>

<p>@ja72, This is in response to your answer.  Please forgive me.  It's been 15 years since I've worked with summations and linear algebra.  I'm having trouble solving the two torque equations for $\psi$ and $\varphi$.  Please look at what I have below and let me know if I'm on the right track.  First I found $F_i$ using your second equation.  </p>

<p>\begin{equation}
F_i=-\frac{W+k(\psi(x_i-x_w)+\varphi(y_i-y_w)}{3k}
\end{equation}
Now I substitute this into your two torque equations and attempt to solve.
\begin{equation}
-\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{W+k(\psi(x_i-x_w)+\varphi(y_i-y_w))}{3k}(y_i-y_w)=0\tag{1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{W+k(\psi(x_i-x_w)+\varphi(y_i-y_w))}{3k}(x_i-x_w)=0\tag{2}
\end{equation}
Rearrange equations 1 and 2
\begin{equation}
\frac{nW}{3k}-\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\psi(x_i-x_w)(y_i-y_w)+\varphi(y_i-y_w)^2}{3}=0\tag{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{nW}{3k}+\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\psi(x_i-x_w)^2+\varphi(y_i-y_w)(x_i-x_w)}{3}=0\tag{4}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \begin{bmatrix}
 \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-x_w)(y_i-y_w)&amp;\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-y_w)^2\\
 \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-x_w)^2&amp; \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-y_w)(x_i-x_w)
 \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
 \psi\\\varphi
 \end{bmatrix}=
 \begin{bmatrix}
 -\frac{nW}{k}\\
 \frac{nW}{k}
 \end{bmatrix}
 \tag{5}
\end{equation}
I doubt this is correct and I do not know how to solve this.  Can you please help me solve for $\psi$ and $\varphi$.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the 2x2 given by ja72.  Notice I have eliminated the $k$ terms on the right hand side since they cancel out in the end.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
A\enspace
\begin{array}{|c|} \psi \\ \varphi
\end{array}=
\begin{array}{|c|}
W(y_w-\overline{y})\\W(x_w-\overline{x})
\end{array}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
A=\begin{bmatrix}
n\overline{x}\overline{y}-\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_iy_i)} &amp; 
\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i^2)}-n\overline{y}^2 \\
\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^2)}-n\overline{x}^2 &amp; 
n\overline{x}\overline{y}-\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_iy_i)}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Implement variable transformation</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
a = n\overline{x}\overline{y}-\sum_i^n(x_iy_i)\quad
b=\sum_i^n(y_i^2)-n\overline{y}^2 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
c=\sum_i^n(x_i^2)-n\overline{x}^2\quad
d=n\overline{x}\overline{y}-\sum_i^n(x_iy_i)
\end{equation}
now <strong>A</strong> becomes
\begin{equation}
A=\begin{bmatrix}
a&amp;b\\c&amp;d
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Solve for $\psi$ and $\varphi$
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{|cc|}
\psi\\\varphi
\end{array}=A^{-1}\enspace
\begin{array}{|cc|}
W(y_w-\overline{y}\\
W(x_w-\overline{x}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\psi=\frac{w}{ad-bc}(b(x_w-\overline{x})-d(y_w-\overline{y}))
\tag{2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\varphi=\frac{w}{ad-bc}(a(y_w-\overline{y})-c(x_w-\overline{x}))
\tag{3}
\end{equation}
Here is the equation for $z_w$.  Again, I have removed the $k$ terms since they all cancel out. 
\begin{multline}
z_w=\frac{1}{n}(W+
\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n}\psi(x_i-x_w)- \varphi(y_i-y_w))
\end{multline}
When we substitute $\psi$ and $\varphi$ we get this ugly thing.
\begin{multline}
z_w=\frac{W}{n}(1+\frac{1}{ad-bc}
\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^n}(d(y_w-\overline{y})-b(x_w-\overline{x}))(x_i-x_w)- \\
(a(x_w-\overline{x})-c(y_w-\overline{y}))(y_i-y_w))
\tag{4}
\end{multline}
Finally we have...
\begin{equation}
F_i=Term1-Term2+Term3
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{eqnarray}
Term1 &amp; = &amp; z_m \\
Term2 &amp; = &amp; \psi(x_i-x_w) \\
Term1 &amp; = &amp; \varphi(y_i-y_w) \\
\end{eqnarray}</p>

  <p>Each of the six ""flavors"" of quarks can have three different ""colors"". The quark forces are attractive only in ""colorless"" combinations of three quarks (baryons), quark-antiquark pairs (mesons) and possibly larger combinations such as the pentaquark that could also meet the colorless condition. Quarks undergo transformations by the exchange of W bosons, and those transformations determine the rate and nature of the decay of hadrons by the weak interaction.</p>

"276014","Bose-Einstein condensation - available states","<p>Bose-Einstein condensation is known to occur if the occupation of the ground state is macroscopic.

"276016","Is EMF generated instantaneously?","<p>I know that EMF is induced when magnetic flux changes over time. But is the production of EMF an instantaneous process or is there a delay in its production? </p>

<p>Consider the example below.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/i6fJX.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/i6fJX.gif"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>By moving the magnet towards the ring I increase the flux. By Lenz's law the current should be induced such that it opposes the change in flux and EMF is induced. But does the process of changing the flux and production of EMF happen at the same time or is there a delay?</p>

<p>An analogous question: is there a delay in production of EMF in an inductor as its current changes? Consider the LR circuit below:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2xzjr.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2xzjr.png"" alt=""current is increasing""></a></p>

<p>The inductor produces back-EMF. According to my teacher, the production of this EMF is done instantaneously(in the same time as the current is changed, further he supported this by giving the analogy of force and production of velocity) whereas I wonder if there is a delay and if the back-EMF produced at $t=1$ is due to the change in current at $t=0$. </p>

<p>Essentially, I don't understand how something can happen instantaneously. I expect there should be a delay in the cause and the effect. It feels like Zeno's dichotomy paradox. I could keep on dividing the time until I reach a point where I could distinguish the cases (here, cause and effect). </p>

<p>I also don't understand the in-depth process behind Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law. I <em>urge</em> you to recommend to me any content that explains ""why"" this happens. </p>

"276020","Velocity of small oscillations","<p>We consider that the displacements about equilibrium are small, in small oscillation. Do we also tacitly assume that the velocity (rather, its magnitude) remains small as well? </p>

<p>Here the $q^{o}$'s represent equilibrium coordinates. Now, they say that since T is already quadratic in the $\dot\eta$'s, we can neglect all terms in the expansion of $m_{ij}$ except the first term. </p>

<p>But doesn't this assume that the $\dot\eta$'s are all small, when it's never been explicitly assumed so?</p>

"276021","Derivation on 3-form Einstein equation from Palatini action","<p>I was asked by a student a derivation problem on 3-form Einstein euqation obtained from Palatini action. He posted some pictures on the book he have been reading.</p>

<p>I derive firstly the gravitational part from Platini action which reads
(for simplification I consider cosmological constant as zero so the term vanishes $\int\sqrt{-g}d^4x\;2\Lambda=0$)：
\begin{align*}
S_G&amp;=\frac{1}{2\kappa}\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}R\xrightarrow{\epsilon_{IJKL}e^I\wedge e^J\wedge R^{KL}=-2|e|R\,dx^4}
\frac{-1}{4\kappa}\int\epsilon_{IJKL}e^I\wedge e^J\wedge R^{KL}=\frac{-1}{4\kappa}\int \text{Tr}(e\wedge e\wedge R)\\
\delta S_G&amp;=\frac{-1}{4\kappa}\delta\int\text{Tr}(e\wedge e\wedge R)=\frac{-1}{2\kappa}\int\text{Tr}(\delta e\wedge e\wedge R)+\frac{-1}{4\kappa}\int\text{Tr}(e\wedge e\wedge\delta R)\\
&amp;(\text{Tr}(\delta e\wedge e\wedge R)+\text{Tr}(e\wedge\delta  e\wedge R)=2\text{Tr}(\delta e\wedge e\wedge R))
\end{align*}
These two parts can be calculated as
\begin{align*}
\int\text{Tr}(\delta e\wedge e\wedge R)&amp;=\int\text{Tr}(e\wedge R\wedge\delta e)=\int\epsilon_{IJKL} e^I\wedge R^{JK}\wedge\delta e^L\\
\int\text{Tr}(e\wedge e\wedge\delta R)&amp;=\int d\text{Tr}(e\wedge e\wedge\delta\omega)-2\int\text{Tr}(De\wedge e\wedge\delta\omega)=-2\int\text{Tr}(\mathscr{T}\wedge e\wedge\delta\omega)\\
&amp;(R=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega\;,\;De^I=de^I+\omega^I_J\wedge e^J=\mathscr{T}^I)
\end{align*}
Then come to matter field part：
\begin{align*}
\delta S_m&amp;=\int d^4x\,\delta(\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{L}_m)\xrightarrow{-g=-\det(g_{\mu\nu})=\det(e)^2=|e|^2}\int d^4x\,\delta(|e|\mathcal{L}_m) =\int|e|d^4x\,\frac{1}{|e|}\delta(|e|\mathcal{L}_m)\\
&amp;=\int\mathcal{V}\frac{1}{|e|}\delta(|e|\mathcal{L}_m)=\int*\left(\frac{1}{|e|}\delta(|e|\mathcal{L}_m)\right)\\
\\
\frac{1}{|e|}\delta(|e|\mathcal{L}_m)&amp;=\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g}\mathcal  {L}_m)}{\delta g_{\alpha\lambda}}\delta g_{\alpha\lambda}=\left(\frac{\delta\mathcal{L}_m}{\delta g_{\alpha\lambda}}-\frac{1}{2}g^{\alpha\lambda}\mathcal{L}_m\right)\delta g_{\alpha\lambda}=-\frac{1}{2}T^{\alpha\lambda}\delta g_{\alpha\lambda}\\
&amp;=-\frac{1}{2}T^{\alpha\lambda}\eta_{NL}(e^{N}_\alpha +\delta^{\lambda}_\alpha \delta^{L}_{N} e_{\lambda}^{L})\delta e_{\lambda}^{L}=-\frac{1}{2}(T^{\alpha\lambda}e_{\alpha L}+T^{\lambda \lambda}e_{\lambda L})\delta e_{\lambda}^{L}=-T_L^\lambda\delta e_{\lambda}^{L}\\
\\
*(T_L^\lambda\delta e_{\lambda}^{L})&amp;=\frac{|e|}{(4-0)!}T_L^\lambda\delta e_{\lambda}^{L}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\lambda}dx^\mu\wedge dx^\nu\wedge dx^\rho\wedge dx^\lambda=\frac{1}{4}T_L\wedge\delta e^L
\end{align*}
Above derivation I have used 4-form voulme and 3-form definition of energy-momentum tensor
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{V}&amp;=|e|d^4x=\frac{1}{4!}\epsilon_{IJKL}e^I_\mu e^J_\nu e^K_\rho e^L_\lambda dx^\mu\wedge dx^\nu\wedge dx^\rho\wedge dx^\lambda=\frac{1}{4!}\epsilon_{IJKL} e^I\wedge e^J\wedge e^K\wedge e^L\\
T_L&amp;=|e|T^\lambda_L\eta_\lambda=\frac{|e|}{3!}T^\lambda_L\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\lambda}dx^\mu\wedge dx^\nu\wedge dx^\rho\\
\end{align*}
When we condider within zero torsion spacetime ($\mathscr{T}=0$) then we will encounter the Einstein equation in 3-form：
\begin{align*}
\epsilon_{IJKL} e^I\wedge R^{JK}=\frac{\kappa}{2} T_L
\end{align*}
Which is $4\pi G$ gravitation coefficient rather then $2\pi G$ on the book.</p>

"276030","Do I see the moon Lorentz contracted if I rotate around myself?","<p>If an object moves at velocity $v$ relative to my frame its length $l_0$ will be Lorentz contracted to the length in my frame $l$:

If I rotate around myself with frequency $\omega$, objects at distance $r$ will have the relative velocity $v = r \omega$. So the moon at a distance of $r=300000$ km should be Lorentz contracted to length $l= 0$, if I rotate around myself with $\omega =1$ Hz (according to the formula $l$ would even get complex, when I would rotate faster).</p>

<p>I haven't done the experiment, but I believe if the moon would be Lorentz contracted somebody would have already noticed that effect. So something must be wrong here. </p>

<p>The funny thing is, I believe that if the moon or a spaceship would rotate around me with a speed of $v &lt; c$, when I must see it Lorentz contracted according to the formula above. So it seems to me the two cases, I rotate around myself and something rotates around me, are not equivalent. In the first case I see no Lorentz contraction, but in the second case I do. Is my thinking correct? If so, can someone explain why these two cases cannot be equivalent and why using the formula for Lorentz contraction must be wrong when I rotate around myself?</p>

"276038","Do the interaction picture fields transform as free fields under boosts?","<p>This post was originally written to ask about transformation properties of fields in the interaction picture of QFT under the Poincare transformations. Arnold Neumaier has pointed out that the question is vacuous, because there is no such thing as interaction picture in relativistic QFT. As far as my (not very educated, I must admit - so please correct me if I'm wrong) understanding goes, the problem is that interacting and non-interacting theories are in a way ""infinitely different"" and one cannot treat both representations of Poincare group and both field operators as well-defined operators acting in the same Hilbert space. This problem is perhaps one of the reasons why QFT is plagued with mathemathical problems. The approach applied by physicists who actually calculate outcomes of experiments is to neglect this problem, treating it as a technical difficulty and then cure resulting inconsistencies and infinities by renormalizaton procedure, leading to consistent results on the level of perturbation theory. In the remainder of this post I will play the game of assuming that interaction picture actually exists, and all calculations presented are purely formal manipulations.</p>

<p>First let's explain notations. Following development in Weinber's book vol. 1, chapters 2 and 3 I expect two representations of Poincare group to exist. $U_0(\Lambda,a)$ transforms asymptotic (in and out) states. $U(\Lambda, a)$ is representation of Poincare group of interacting theory. The relation between the generators of two representations is $H=H_0+V$, $\vec P = \vec P_0$, $\vec J = \vec J_0$, $\vec K = \vec K_0 + \vec W$, where $\vec W$ is correction term which needs to satisfy certain conditions to yield a Lorentz covariant theory (in the sense that $U_0$ commutes with the $S$ operator) - details are described in Weinberg. $\phi(x)$ is some quantum field in the Heisenberg picture. It can be a tensor, spinor or whatever and I neglect relevant indices. It transforms according to
$$ U(\Lambda, a) \phi(x) U(\Lambda,a)^{\dagger}= D(\Lambda ^{-1}) \phi (\Lambda x +a),  $$
where $D$ is some finite dimensional representation of Lorentz group. This is the matrix which acts on Lorentz or spinor indices of $\phi$. Therefore saying what is $D$ is equivalent to specifying the algebraic type of the field $\phi$ - for example $D(\Lambda)=1$ corresponds to a scalar field, $D(\Lambda)=\Lambda$ is a vector field etc.</p>

<p>Now I choose an inertial frame and attempt to define fields in the interaction picture $\phi_I(x)$ as
$$ \phi_I(x) = U_0(x) \phi (0) U_0(x)^{\dagger}. $$
From the definition, $\phi_I(x)=\phi(x)$ if $x^0=0$ but not otherwise. This definition can be rewritten as
$$ \phi_I(x) = U_I(x) \phi(x) U_I(x)^{\dagger}, $$
where $U_I(a)=U_0(a)U(a)^{\dagger}$. It follows easily from the definitions so far that if $R$ is a rotation and $a$ and arbitrary vector then
$$ U_0(R,a) \phi_I(x) U_0(R,a) = D(R^{-1}) \phi_I(R x +a), $$
and in this sense interaction picture fields $\phi_I(x)$ transform as free fields under the Poincare group. However, I fail to reproduce the same result if rotation $R$ is replaced by boost or some general Lorentz transformation. The best I can get is
$$ U_0(\Lambda, a) \phi_I(x) U_0(\Lambda,a)^{\dagger}=D_0(\Lambda^{-1}) \phi_I(\Lambda x +a), $$
where $D_0$ is some, but not necessarily the same representation of Lorentz group. This seems odd, because introduction of interactions shouldn't change the algebraic character of the fields.</p>

<p>My question can be put as follows: Is there a way to argue that (at least under some assumptions about interactions) the representations $D$ and $D_0$ are equal? </p>

"276050","Arrows propelled by spring force","<p>I don't think that anyone has ever calculated this (correct me if I'm wrong on this), so I want to ask professionals if it is right or wrong?</p>

<p>we know that the force that controls arrows in the ""arrow and bow"" weapon is ""spring force""</p>

<p>what I have done is calculating how much long you must pull the arrow (let's say $(n)$ meters long) to make the initial velocity for the arrow equal some constant $(vi)$</p>

<p>We know that $F$(spring)=-$kx$ , and $F=ma$</p>

<p>$-kx=ma$</p>

<p>$-kx=m*dv/dt$</p>

<p>$-kx=m*d^2x/dt^2$</p>

<p>solving this differential equation gives us</p>

<p>$x(t) =c1*cos(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t) + c2*sin(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t)$</p>

<p>t is zero the second you release the arrow, and when you want to release the arrow x will be $(-n)$, (if we pull the arrow to the left and assume that when $n=0 , x=0 )$</p>

<p>and if we put $x=-n$ and $t=0$ we will get $c1=-n$</p>

<p>therefore </p>

<p>$x(t) =-n*cos(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t) + c2*sin(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t)$</p>

<p>and the second you release the arrow $(t=0)$ the velovity will be $0 (x'(0)=0)$</p>

<p>$x'(t) = \sqrt{(k/m)}*n*sin(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t) + \sqrt{(k/m)}*c2*cos(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t)$</p>

<p>and if we put $x'=0$ and $t=0$ we will get $c2=0$</p>

<p>therefore the equation will be</p>

<p>$x(t)=-n*cos(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t)$</p>

<p>where n is how much long you pull the arrow , and m is the mass of the arrow , and k is the spring constant , and t is time</p>

<p>now we want to know what is the initial velocity that the arrow will travel with when it get out of the bow, and for that we want to know the velocity at the second when the force stops affecting on the arrow, because the acceleration will become $0$ and the velocity will become a constant velocity, and this all happens when $x(t)=0 $</p>

<p>$x(t)=0$</p>

<p>$-n*cos(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t)=0$</p>

<p>Arrows propelled by spring force of bow</p>

<p>$cos(\sqrt{(k/m)}*t)=0$
(and that happens just for one time)</p>

<p>therefore $ \sqrt{(k/m)}*t = \pi/2$</p>

<p>hence, $ t=(\sqrt{(m/k)}*\pi)/2$</p>

<p>that is the time when the tail of the arrow reaches the point $x=0$ and its velocity at that time will be its initial velocity </p>

<p>so $vi = x'((\sqrt{(m/k)}*\pi)/2) = \sqrt{(k/m)}*n * sin(\sqrt{(k/m)}* (\sqrt{(m/k)}*\pi)/2)$</p>

<p>$ vi=\sqrt{(k/m)}* n *sin(\pi/2)$</p>

"276052","The muon experiment from the muon's frame of reference","<p>I was considering the muon experiment that is typically used to provide a justification to special relativity.</p>

<p>I understand the experiment from the Earth observer's perspective (with time dilation). However, I have trouble understanding the experiment from the muon's perspective.</p>

<p>I understand that the length should contract, but what I do not understand is why time dilation does not occur. From the muon's perspective, isn't the Earth moving towards it at a very high speed? If so, shouldn't the time it takes the Earth to travel to and meet up with the muon dilate? Therefore, wouldn't the effects of time dilation and length contraction cancel out?</p>

"276053","Trouble with operator-sum representation of a quantum operation","<p>I am reading about the operator-sum representation of quantum operations in Nielsen's and Chuang's 10th ed of <em>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</em> (N&amp;C). I have become quite confused by some of the basic formalism presented therein. I'll get right to it.</p>

<p>N&amp;C gives the definition of a quantum operation $\mathcal{E}$, for an input system $A$ in an initial state $\rho_{A}$ and environment $B$ in an initial pure state $|0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|$, as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}(\rho_{A})=\text{Tr}_{B}\big(U(\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|)U^{\dagger}\big)
\end{equation}
where $U$ is some transformation on the whole system. N&amp;C then proceeds toward the operator-sum representation by expressing the partial trace $\text{Tr}_{B}$ using a finite orthonormal basis $\{|i_{B}\rangle\}$ for $B$ as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{E}(\rho_{A})&amp;=\text{Tr}_{B}\big(U(\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|)U^{\dagger}\big)
&amp;=\sum_{i}{\langle i_{B}|\big(U(\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|)U^{\dagger}\big)|i_{B}\rangle}\overset{*}{=}\sum_{i}{E_{i}\rho_{A}E^{\dagger}_{i}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the last equality (*) is nothing but the operation-sum representation of the operation $\mathcal{E}$. The elements $\{E_{i}\}$  of this representation are written $E_{k}\equiv \langle k_{B}|U|0_{B}\rangle$ and these are operators.</p>

<p>What I am unable to see is the rationale/reasoning for the equality (*) above. <strong>This is a problem to me and is what I would like to solve.</strong></p>

<p>Why I am having trouble is perhaps because of the partial trace. I can't see how it is legitimate to write out the partial trace by using <em>only</em> the basis $\{|i_{B}\rangle\}$ as above, the dimensions do not seem to be in order as to make a meaningful expression. I would rather change to
\begin{equation}
|i_{B}\rangle\to \mathbb{I}^{A}\otimes |i_{B}\rangle
\end{equation}
whereby
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}(\rho^{A})=\sum_{i}{\mathbb{I}^{A}\otimes \langle i_{B}|\big(U(\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|)U^{\dagger}\big)\mathbb{I}^{A}\otimes |i_{B}\rangle}
\end{equation}
as this is how I understand the partial trace. I would believe that, say, $U^{\dagger}(\mathbb{I}^{A}\otimes |k_{B}\rangle)$ is well-defined as I see dimensions of both operators (matrices) being just right. Then, if my understanding of the partial trace is correct, I would have
\begin{equation}
E_{k}=\langle k_{B}|U|0_{B}\rangle\to (\mathbb{I}^{A}\otimes \langle k_{B}|)U(\mathbb{I}^{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)
\end{equation}
which is an expression where one can at least <em>see</em> that an $E_{k}$ is <strong>not</strong> a scalar, as opposed to how it is written by N&amp;C.</p>

<p>Now, if the transformation $U$ was not present I would have no problem taking the partial trace this way. As this is not the case, I'm stuck. I have no idea as how to rearrange within the terms in the sum so that I get the elements $\{E_{i}\}$.</p>

<p>Any effort to help with this matter is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> With the input from Norbert Schuch I have come to understand the following. The trick allowing for suitably rearranging within each term of the partial trace lies in expanding $\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|$ into products as
\begin{equation}
\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}| = \underbrace{(\rho_{A}\otimes \mathbb{I}_{B})(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)}_{=(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)\rho_{A}}(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes \langle 0_{B}|)=(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)\rho_{A}(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes \langle 0_{B}|)\hspace{1mm},
\end{equation}
where the last equality can be seen through
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\rho_{A}\otimes \mathbb{I}_{B})(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)&amp;=(\underbrace{\rho_{A}\mathbb{I}_{A}}_{\text{commutes}})\otimes (\underbrace{\mathbb{I}_{B}|0_{B}\rangle}_{=|0_{B}\rangle=|0_{B}\rangle\cdot 1})\\[2mm]
&amp;=(\mathbb{I}_{A}\rho_{A})\otimes (|0_{B}\rangle\cdot 1)\\[2mm]
&amp;=(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)(\underbrace{\rho_{A}\otimes 1}_{=\rho_{A}})\\[2mm]
&amp;=(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)\rho_{A}\hspace{1mm}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Note the usage of the so-called <em>mixed product property</em>, i.e., $(A\otimes B)(C\otimes D)=(AC)\otimes(BD)$.</p>

<p>Then, considering the $k$:th term in the partial trace sum, we have that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&amp; \mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes \langle k_{B}|\big(U(\rho_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle\langle 0_{B}|)U^{\dagger}\big)\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |k_{B}\rangle\\[2mm]
=&amp; \underbrace{(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes \langle k_{B}|)U(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |0_{B}\rangle)}_{=E_{k}}\rho_{A}\underbrace{(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes \langle 0_{B}|)U^{\dagger}(\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes |k_{B}\rangle)}_{=E^{\dagger}_{k}} \\[2mm]
=&amp; E_{k}\rho_{A} E^{\dagger}_{k} \hspace{1mm}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>I am pleased by Norbert's input on this matter and as far as my perspective goes I consider my question to be solved. Thank you very much.</p>

"276055","Central charges in the supersymmetry algebra of the $d = 10$ Type-IIA theory","<p>According to Witten's paper, ''<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124"" rel=""nofollow"">String Theory Dynamics in Various Dimensions</a>'' [<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124"" rel=""nofollow"">arXiv:hep-th/9503124</a>], the supersymmetry algebra for the Type-IIA theory in 10 dimensions has the structure $\{Q, Q\} \sim \{Q', Q'\} \sim P$, where $Q_\alpha$ and $Q'_{\dot{\alpha}}$ denote the supersymmetry generators of the two chiralities, and that a central charge can appear in the anticommutator $\{Q_{\alpha}, Q_{\dot{\alpha}}'\} \sim \delta_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}W$ (all this appears on page 5 of the paper).</p>

<p>However, very naively, this seems to be slightly at variance with Chris Hull's paper, ''<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9705162v3"" rel=""nofollow"">Gravitational Duality, Branes and Charges</a>'' [<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9705162v3"" rel=""nofollow"">arXiv:hep-th/9705162v3</a>]. Specifically, in Hull's paper, equation (2.2) gives the $\{Q, Q\}$ anticommutator (in Witten's language), which in general also includes central charges. Why can't the central chage ''W'' of Witten could in principle enter in equation (2.2) of Hull?</p>

<p>In $\mathcal{N} &gt; 1$ supersymmetry in $d = 4$, one finds that $\{Q, Q'\} \sim P$ whereas $\{Q, Q\} \sim \text{central charges}$. This pattern changes in $d = 10$ for Type-IIA: what is the moral to be drawn from this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It is clear to me that in 11D, the SUSY algebra has the ''normal'' form, $\{Q, Q\} \sim P$, and compactifying on a circle, the $11^{th}$ component of $P$ yields what is called the central charge $W$ in Witten's paper.  My question is about the apparent discrepancy in the two sources above, <em>and</em> about getting this result without compactifying down from eleven dimensions.</p>

"276057","Query on statiscal mechanics and thermodynamics properties","<p>Hello I have a question abot some thermodynamics quontites.
I know that the internal energy is defined as </p>

<p>$$\delta U= \mathrm{Tr}[\rho H]$$</p>

<p>where $\mathrm{Tr}$ stands for the trace, $\rho= \frac{e^{-\beta H}}{Z}$ with $\beta=1/T$ and $T$ is the temperature and $H$ is the Hamiltonian. If I differentiate that I get </p>

<p>$$\delta U = \mathrm{Tr}[\delta \rho H + \rho \delta H]$$</p>

<p>The first quantity is identified as heat $\delta Q = \mathrm{Tr}[\delta \rho H]$ and work $\delta W = - \mathrm{Tr}[\rho \delta H]$. If I start with entropy with von Neumann's definition I have $$S = - \mathrm{Tr}[\rho \ln \rho]$$ and differentiating I get
$$\delta S = \beta \mathrm{Tr}[\delta \rho H - \rho\delta H]$$
So here's my question. The thermodynamic relation is $$T\delta S= \delta U + \delta W$$. In the above relation (the one with the trace) I can identify the work but if I identify the former term it should be what I call heat and I would get $$T \delta S = \delta Q + \delta W$$ </p>

<p>Where's the mistake? Why is contradictory this? Why should I identify the former quantity as internal energy if I called it heat??</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{Strength}{density \times radius^2}}$$</p>

<p>Strength would be something like the yield strength, because a plastically deformed disk counts as ""failed"". But not exactly yield strength, because we leave room for a safety factor.</p>

<p>(Please yell if that's wrong. My reasoning is that the problem has the same structure as a pressure vessel, the ""pressure"" here instead being the centrifugal ""force"" acting on each piece of the wall. So the tension on the wall is just ""pressure"" multiplied by the diameter, divided by two because there's a wall on each side. Set tension = strength of the wall material, then rearrange to give critical speed.)</p>

<p>One could simply treat a solid cylinder as a series of thin-shelled ones, but I'm sure that's wrong because it ignores the radial strength of the material the cylinder is made of. I'm probably struggling here because my mental model of mechanical tension is scalar-like, while i think it's actually a higher-ranked tensor - I'm just too tensor-illiterate to be able to apply that.</p>

<p>Where do I go from here? My engineering problem is solved if I just had a formula, but ideally I'd like an explanation/derivation, or at least the outline of one. The engineering problem is to have an upper bound to how fast one can safely rotate a shaft/disk.</p>

"276123","Beyond QKD, which types of quantum entanglement experiments will QUESS likely facilitate?","<p>In the recent Xinhua press release <a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-08/16/c_135601026.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">China launches first-ever quantum communication satellite</a> the last two sentences (which are two paragraphs) outline several distinct experiments planned for the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) satellite in conjunction with either one or two ground stations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the help of the new satellite, scientists will be able to test quantum key distribution between the satellite and ground stations, and conduct secure quantum communications between Beijing and Xinjiang's Urumqi.</p>
  
  <p>QUESS, as planned, will also beam entangled photons to two earth stations, 1,200 kilometers apart, in a move to test quantum entanglement over a greater distance, as well as test quantum teleportation between a ground station in Ali, Tibet, and itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I try to make an outline, I get the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>QKD between the satellite and ground stations</li>
<li>secure quantum communications between Beijing and... Urumqi</li>
<li>beam entangled photons to two earth stations (1,200km apart)</li>
<li>test quantum teleportation between a ground station... and itself</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is my current understanding of those:</p>

<ol>
<li>QUESS produces a pair of entangled photons, <em>sends one photon</em> to a ground station and simultaneously measures the other internally.</li>
<li>Don't understand - QKD by #3, or something different?  Uses second public path for the encrypted data? Since Beijing to the Xinjiang Observatory is over 2400km, I'm thinking <em>Store and Repeat</em>?</li>
<li>QUESS produces a pair of entangled photons, <em>sends both photons</em> - each to different ground stations for simultaneous measurement.</li>
<li>Not sure - is this more of a ""science experiment"" related to entanglement but not necessarily for secure information transfer?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm looking for an answer which <strong>helps me understand the most likely interpretation</strong> of the experiments mentioned in <strong>items 2 and 4</strong> - a clarification of what the experiment is likely to be intended to do, not an explanation of the underlying quantum mechanics of entanglement. </p>

<p>Because of the mixture of publicly conducted science and government interests, the answer may need to contain a bit of speculation or 'most likely experimental scenario' from someone familliar with the field.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/274764/83380"">helpful answer</a> and the Nature article cited there has helpful information, and also goes on to mention some confusion on geographic sites in a different (New York Times) article.

<p>The phase mask is basically a liquid crystal SLM device with a certain resolution. I implemented my simulation using <a href=""https://spie.org/etop/1995/689_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">J.Shamir</a> operator algebra (the link is a lecture, the original paper is not free) notation which is Matlab friendly and now I would like to compute the mathematical expression of the transparency I have to add in order to reproduce the diffraction effects of the resolution (for example 1920x1080).  </p>

<p>I rephrase it once just so it s clear. The SLM performs a phase shift but due to the resolution of the device, an unwanted diffraction might appear. Higher resolution means more diffraction. Im interested in the mathematical expression of the transparency $t_A(f_x,f_y)$ such that:</p>

<p>$U_{out}=t_A U_{in}$</p>

<p>where $U_{in}$ is the theoretical phasor and $U_{out}$ is the phasor closer to the reality (in Fourier space). </p>

"276134","Energy of background radiation while falling into a black hole","<p>As you fall into a black hole, the old story is you would be spaghettified - and this question is not about that.</p>

<p>However passing of time would be warped, so you would see the future of the universe unfold as you cross the event horizon? This means that you will be receiving the combined radiation energy of the universe's future in what I imagine is an instant.</p>

<p>To me, this implies that black holes have inside them the combined radiation energy of the entire universe, while simultaneously for us outside of the black hole - they don't.</p>

<p>Purely in terms of energy, every black hole contains within them an entire universe of energy - <strong>as seen from <em>inside</em> the black hole</strong>?</p>

<p>To summarize my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Beyond the event horizon, does the blue shift caused by time dilation overcome the red shift caused by acceleration toward the black hole?</p></li>
<li><p>Would all black holes receive the combined radiation of rest of the universe and would the universe have to be open, flat or closed for this to hold true?</p></li>
<li><p>How does black hole evaporation fit into this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've been obsessed with this idea, that becomes a consequence of this. It basically means that <em>if</em> any particle in the universe eventually will end up inside a black hole - it already has entered that black hole <em>as seen from within that black hole</em>.</p>

<p>So in a collapsing universe, a black hole can be as ""rich"" as our entire universe in terms of mass and energy. Every black hole in the universe contains the entire universe. The mass inside it would simply be the future of the mass we have here.</p>

"276142","Condition for no singularity on physical sheet","<p>I have been reading Landau Lifshitz ""Quantum Mechanics: Non Relativistic Theory"". I am quoting a paragraph from Volume 3, 3rd Ed. section 128 pg. 527 here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We shall show however, that there is nevertheless a class of field for which the function A(E) has no singularity on the physical sheet although the condition 128.6 is not satisfied.</p>
  
  <p>(128.6) U(r) decreases more rapidly than exp(- (2sqrt(2m)/h) r re(sqrt(-E))) as r -> infinity</p>
  
  <p>To do so we regard X as a function of a complex variable r for a given complex value of E. Here we need only consider values of E in the upper half plane since the values of the function A(E) in the two half planes are complex conjugates. For values of r such that Er² is real and positive, the two terms in the wave function 128.1 are of the same order, i.e. we return to the situation which occurs when E>0 and r is real, when both terms in the asymptotic expression for X are legitimate for any field U(r) which tends to zero at infinity. We can therefore say that A(E) cannot have singular points
  for values of E such that U(r) -> 0 when r -> oo along a line on which Er² > 0. When E takes all values in the upper half-plane, the condition Er² > 0
  selects the lower right quadrant in the complex r-plane. Thus we conclude
  that A(E) also has no singularity on the physical sheet when U(r) satisfies the condition -</p>
  
  <p>(128.13) U(r) -> 0 when r -> oo in the right half-plane</p>
  
  <p>(128.1)  x = nf, = A(E) exp(- sqrt(-2mE)/h r) + B(E) exp(sqrt(-2mE)/h r)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So firstly, I don't understand how does the condition Er² appear out of nowhere. How does it being satisfied imply that the two terms are of the same order. How does the condition Er² > 0 select lower right quadrant when E is having values in upper half plane.</p>

"276148","Emissivity and Black-body Characteristics of Tungsten","<p>Ok I'm totally out of my depth here as I'm only a student but I'm confused about the relationship between the emissivity and black-body characteristics of tungsten.

"276172","Topological invariant for graphene","<p>I try to understand the concept of topological invariants in condensed matter specially in the case of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariante and graphene.</p>

<p>From Fradkins book I know that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariante can be written as</p>

<p>$$
\left(-1\right)^{\nu} = \prod_{i}\delta_{i} = \prod_{i}\frac{\sqrt{\det\left(w\left(\vec{Q}_{i}\right)\right)}}{\text{pf}\left(w\left(\vec{Q}_{i}\right)\right)}
$$</p>

<p>where $w_{mn}\left(\vec{k}\right) = \langle u_{m}\left(-\vec{k}\right)|\Theta|u_{n}\left(\vec{k}\right)\rangle$, $\Theta$ the time-reversal Operator, $u_{n}\left(\vec{k}\right)$ are the Bloch eigenfunctions and $\vec{Q}_{i}$ are the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone $\vec{Q}_{i} = -\vec{Q}_{i} + \vec{G}$, usually $\vec{Q}_{i}\in\{\left(0,0\right),\left(\pi,0\right),\left(0,\pi\right),\left(\pi,\pi\right)\}$.</p>

<p>My question is now what happens in the case of graphene (i.e. the Kane and Mele model) with the Definition of $\vec{Q}_{i}$? In the book by Bernevig the pfaffian is calculated at the Dirac points $K$ and $K^{\prime}$ (as long as the $C_{3}$ is unbroken). Therefore, in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant should have the following form for graphene:</p>

<p>$$
\left(-1\right)^{\nu} = \frac{\sqrt{\det\left(w\left(K\right)\right)}}{\text{pf}\left(w\left(K\right)\right)}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{\det\left(w\left(K^{\prime}\right)\right)}}{\text{pf}\left(w\left(K^{\prime}\right)\right)}\text{.}
$$</p>

<p>Intuitively, it is clear to me why, because at these points the energy gap is closing. However, I also want to understand from a mathematical point of view why we can write the topological invariant as a pfaffian at specific points in the Brillouin zone.</p>

"276177","What polarization is indicated by an arrow annotated by TM","<p>I have an optical fiber-based electro-optic modulator that allows to introduce a phase shift to light propagating through the device proportional to an applied voltage. However, the phase-shift is only induced to one of the two linear polarization components. On the supplied drawing, they indicate the polarization using an arrow to which TM is annotated. What would that mean? Usually, an arrow indicating a polarization would indicate the plane of the electric field. TM usually stands for transverse-magnetic, implying the plane of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence. However, in fiber-based device, there is no clear plane of incidence. Should I therefore interpret the drawn arrow as the 'plane of incidence' to which the magnetic field is perpendicular, or as an indication of the plane of magnetic field?
Of course, the device is equipped with polarization maintaining fibers, such that it is actually possible to send in light at a well defined polarization. </p>

"276194","What happens when two point charges of opposite nature and same rest mass having finite separation, when they are released from rest?","<p>Do they collide or stick to each other?
I considered two point charges $+q$ and $-q$ respectively.<br>
They both have same rest mass $m_0$.<br>
Initial distance between them was $r_0$ and both were at rest.<br>
Since magnetic field at any point along the line joining them is 0 in magnitude I have not considered it.<br>
If relative acceleration of $+q$ with respect to $-q$ is $a$ then it can be written in the form $a=v\frac{dv}{dr}$.<br>
Where $v$ is the relative velocity of $+q$ with respect to $-q$ and $r$ is the distance between them at any instant.
So, $v\frac{dv}{dr}=\frac{\kappa q^2}{\gamma m_0r_s^2}$<br>
Where $\kappa$ is Coloumb's constant , and $\gamma$ is Lorentz's factor.<br>
$r_s=\gamma r$<br>
Is my setup right and I am not sure which velocity to put in the Lorentz's factor $\gamma$(because when I put it $v$ then solving the above equation gives the value $v\to c$ when $r\to0$.)</p>

"276195","How can I normalize a given wave function with delta functions?","<p>I have a 3D metal semiconductor junction with the metal side wavefunction given by the equation below considering transmission in $z$-direction(transport). $k_m$ is the wavevector in the metal side and <strong>ks</strong> in the semiconductor side. $m_m$ and $m_s$ are the respective electron masses in the metal and semiconductor side.</p>

<p>I would like to normalize the wavefunctions on the two sides using delta functions.
$$
  \text Metal \\ \psi_1(z) = \exp(ik_m*z)+ A*\exp(-ik_m*z)
$$
$$
  \text Semiconductor \\
  \psi_2(z) = B*\exp(ik_s*z)
$$
assuming:
$$
  \psi_1(0) =\psi_2(0)   
$$</p>

<p>$$
  1+A= B
$$
$$
 \frac{1}{m_m}*\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \psi_1(0) = \frac{1}{m_s}*\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \psi_2(0)
$$</p>

<p>When I try to normalize the semiconductor side, I get
$$ B=1/\sqrt{2\pi}$$ but when I try to normalize the wavefunction on the metal side the results don't make sense. </p>

<p>Can some explain how can I normalize the wavefunctions using delta functions?
Does it make sense to do so?</p>

<p>edit:
Normalization for semiconductor:
$$
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(ks)*\psi^*(ks')\,\mathrm{d}z = \delta(ks-ks')
$$</p>

"276203","Why do air conditioners ""freeze"" in humid (but hot) weather?","<p>I live in the Middle East where the temperatures often are north of 50C in the summer.</p>

<p>As long as the humidity is low, the AC units perform very well and cool the apartment easily.</p>

<p>If relative humidity is high (usually we can tell this by the haze in the morning or when condensation start forming on glass windows), then the AC struggles to keep the house cool - but what's more interesting, it starts forming ice (on the cooling pipes) and this ice soon starts melting which leads to further issues that water starts leaking from the AC compressor unit.</p>

<p>My question therefore is, how can the ice formation be explained, and what is its relation to humidity and cooling?</p>

<p>In light of the comment below, I would like to clarify that I am not looking for a solution to the problem, I'm trying to understand the physics or the reasons behind it. I know that blasting some air through some of the drainage holes usually solves it; but I'm curious what is it specifically about humidity that makes this happen.</p>

"276220","Bohr / De Broglie postulate (what does n λ= 2 π r imply)","<p>From the Bohr/De Broglie postulate we have n λ = 2πr where λ is the De-Broglie wavelength , r is the radius corresponding to n and n is the quantum number.</p>

<ol>
<li>An electron in the state n=2 has more energy than that at n=1</li>
<li>That implies that the De- Broglie wavelength  associated with the electron should also decrease ?</li>

<p>Any measurement of r has an uncertainty ∆r, and both give the possible location of the electron (or where it was) with some predefined probability associated to ∆r (90%, or standard deviation, or etc). I suppose that the current precision must be ∆r &lt; 2Å, cause this is roughly the size of light atoms and we all have seen pictures where different atoms can be resolved, so you can always affirm that the electron of that atom is within 2Å with a predefined probability.</p>

"276226","An arguement for principle of maximum entropy which I dont understand","<p>While having a look at a book on statistical  physics (Statistical Physics and Protein Folding), I came across an argument for principal of maximum entropy which I dont understand. It goes as follows. Assume there two subsystems $S_1$ and $S_2$ in contact with each other with total energy $E=E_1 + E_2$. Total energy is constant but the subsystems are allowed to transfer energy to each other. Assume that the we have a experimental resolution $\Delta$ for energy levels of the system AND $E_0$ is the minimum energy the subsystems can achieve. Let $\Gamma_1(E_1)$ and $\Gamma_2(E_2)=\Gamma_2(E-E_1)$ be the total number of accessible states in each subsystem with given energy $E_1$. Then the total number of states in the whole system is $\sum_{E_0 &lt; E_1 &lt; E}\Gamma_1(E_1)\Gamma_2(E-E_1)$ and the total entropy is then
 $S(E)= k_B ln(\sum_{E_0 &lt; E_1 &lt; E}\Gamma_1(E_1)\Gamma_2(E-E_1))$. Now assume that in the summation the maximum term is achieved at $E_1 = \bar{E}_1$. Then this summation (i.e the total entropy) has the lower bound
$$
 k_B ln(\Gamma_1(\bar{E}_1)\Gamma_2(E-\bar{E}_1)), 
$$ 
and the upper bound
$$
 k_B ln(\Gamma_1(\bar{E}_1)\Gamma_2(E-\bar{E}_1)) + k_Bln(\frac{E}{\Delta}).
$$
Then the book goes on saying that in a macroscopic system of N particles we expect $S$ and $E$ both to be of order $N$. Therefore we can write
$$
S(E) = k_bln\Gamma_1(\bar{E}_1) + k_bln\Gamma_2(E-\bar{E}_1) +O(ln(\frac{N}{\Delta}))
$$
So then if we ""neglect"" the last term then 
$$
S(E) = S(\bar{E}_1) + S(\bar{E}_2)
$$
with $\bar{E}_2 = E -\bar{E}_1$. Now the principle of maximim entropy says entropy of an isolated system never decreases. I dont quite understand how the equation above gives us this since I dont see how the equation above says anything about subsystems $S_1$ or $S_2$. I dont think it implies that the system $S_1$ prefers the energy $\bar{E}_1$ and moreover as our ability to make more precise measurement increases and $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ the error term $ln$ grows and so it sort of says that the above equality is susceptible to fluctuations. Can somebody clarify these points?</p>

<p>By expand I mean the device might send probes to nearby galaxies, and use resources from those galaxies to produce more probes to other galaxies. Also produced is some kind of memory device and a communication relay, allowing it to function as a ""memory expansion"". </p>

<p>Such a device would be a true physical realization of a Turing machine!*</p>

<p>Limits I can think of are the 2nd law of thermodynamics and of course the speed of light. But perhaps if this device expands faster than the decrease of the rate of computation due to </p>

<p>1) Increasing entropy</p>

<p>2) Increasing device radius (the communication cost per step should be proportional to intergalactic distance)</p>

<p>can it still perform arbitrarily many operations?</p>

<p>A Turing Machine consists of four elements: an infinite <strong>tape</strong>, a read/write <strong>head</strong>, a finite <strong>state register</strong> and a finite <strong>instruction table</strong>.</p>

<p>Each galaxy stores a constant $k$ amount of bits, thus galaxies function as a tape. The probe contains the state register and optionally also the instruction table and head. Thus we have a Turing Machine, provided the probe doesn't run out of energy.</p>

"276251","Can a balloon be inflated with electrons?","<p>If I use a Van De Graff generator to pump electrons into a deflated balloon, eventually negative charge will start to build up inside the balloon. Assume the mouth of the balloon is sealed so air can not enter or exit the balloon. The electrons will push against each other and from my understanding build up mostly along the inner surface of the balloon.</p>

<p>Will these electrons push against the sides of the balloon strongly enough to inflate the balloon or will this whole setup be impossible for some reason I am not seeing like the electrons drifting through the balloon walls too quickly to build up?</p>

<p>Assume the balloon is as thick as necessary.</p>

<p>Edit 1:
I was imagining that as more and more electrons are pumped in some would start colliding with the walls of the balloon. These constant collisions with the balloon walls would cause a ""pressure"" outward on the walls of the balloon, the same way air molecules colliding with balloon walls creates pressure. Why would the balloon not just inflate like it does with air after the relatively small amount of pressure required to inflate balloons is reached? I agree the ""pressure"" to add electrons would raise quickly, but that leads me to think it would inflate with fairly ""few"" electrons added.</p>

<p>Edit 2:
Sorry for the follow up questions. I am by no means claiming the balloon would inflate, I just don't understand why air would work and electrons would not. If the balloon wall absorbs some electrons, won't it become negatively charged quite quickly and then directly feel a repulsive force with the other walls of the balloon and the still free electrons? Then it would inflate by a direct force instead of the indirect collisions of the electrons on its walls.</p>

<p>Edit 3: Thank you for all of the interest in this question. Due to some questions in comments I will provide some clarification details. After reading observations from count_to_10, Hames Large, and Marty Green regarding ""hot"" vs ""cold"" electrons, I see the experiment as the following diagram:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vQ4qw.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vQ4qw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>A) The environment outside the balloon. This could either be air or a vacuum, so long as the entire experiment could fit inside a modern vacuum chamber.</p>

<p>B) The interior of the balloon (marked in red). As Ulthran pointed out this would essentially be a vacuum with possibly some electrons drifting around.</p>

<p>C) The top ball of a Van De Graff generator. Andrea Di Biagio pointed out that we have to be careful to not let all the charge accumulate in one spot. Normally the ball at the top would be flat, but here there are points attached to help the electrons discharge from the ball in a more or less uniform pattern. This design is from my limited knowledge of Van De Graff generators. Please feel free to suggest something else if there is a better way to move ""cold"" electrons into the balloon.</p>

<p>D) Here is the mouth of the balloon. This is somehow firmly attached to the pole of the Van De Graff generator with a highly insulating material. The goal is that the electrons will not move to the pole and air will not be able to enter the balloon and electrons will not be able to exit.</p>

<p>I think Andrea Di Biagio is the closest to a definite answer so far. The calculation arrived at about $N = 4.633*10^{13}$ electrons required to generate enough pressure (Thanks to Rotsor for some calculation adjustments). So the question is, can we fit this many electrons inside the balloon (turns out they all end up on the inside wall of the balloon), or will something happen to stop this, for example leaking through the balloon wall, dielectric breakdown, rubber chemical bonds breaking or something else?</p>

"276257","Is electric potential a 4D function?","<p>First of all, i don't know if my question makes any physical sense at all, but it is something that is killing me and my teacher couldn't answer it.
In calculus we have that if $ f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ , then
$ \bigtriangledown f $ will be $ \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $.
My interpretation of this is that the gradient will <em>always</em> have one dimension less that its function. Then, in electromagnetism we have
$ \vec{E} = - \bigtriangledown V $
Since $ vec{E} $ is an 3D vector field, then $ V $ should be 4-dimensional, but that does not make much sense to me.

"276267","What are the equations governing a coupled oscillator system, i.e. one where the energy is passed between states?","<p>A while ago I witnessed a machine that consisted of a mass hanging from a weak spring. One could pull it down a little bit and twist the spring too (torsional pendulum style) and it would oscillate between 2 modes—springing up and down and acting like a torsional pendulum (energy goes back and forth). At a certain initial energy, each mode has a certain energy that doesn't change with time.
How does this work (i.e. which equations govern it)? My feeling is that the spring constant k depends somewhat on the torsion of the spring, but I'm not sure.</p>

"276289","Brief derivation of the double slit experiment - is this correct?","<p>I know this has been done to death so I will try to be succinct.</p>

<p>Say $\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2$ are the positions of two pinholes on a non-permissive barrier plane, and we have a region $S$ corresponding to a screen behind and parallel to this barrier.</p>

<p>If we cover $\mathbf{v}_2$ and shine light through $\mathbf{v}_1$, then the light wave past the slits (up to scale, falloff) is given by:
$$f_{1}(\mathbf{z},t)=\mathrm{Re}\{\exp( \ i\cdot(\mathbf{v}_1\cdot \mathbf{z}+f\cdot t)\ )\},$$
and similarly for $f_2$.</p>

<p>Now if we shine light through both slits, the light wave past the slits is given by:
$$f_1(\mathbf{z},t)+f_2(\mathbf{z},t)=\mathrm{Re}\{\exp( \ i\cdot(\mathbf{v}_1\cdot \mathbf{z}+f\cdot t)\ )+\exp( \ i\cdot(\mathbf{v}_2\cdot \mathbf{z} + f\cdot t)\ )\}.$$</p>

<p>If we shoot a photon randomly at the two open slits without a detector, the probability mass of it landing on the screen at a point $\mathbf{z}_S\in S$ will be (proportional to, with falloff):
$$\int_{[0,\delta_t]} \| \mathrm{Real}(f_1(\mathbf{z}_S,t)+f_2(\mathbf{z}_S,t)) \|^2 dt.$$</p>

<p>The distribution will look like the interference pattern shown on the bottom of this image: <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Single_slit_and_double_slit2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Single_slit_and_double_slit2.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now if we put a detector on one of the slits and shoot a photon, it lands with this distribution:
$$\int_{[0,\delta_t]} \| \mathrm{Real}(f_1(\mathbf{z}_S,t))\|^2+\|\mathrm{Real}(f_2(\mathbf{z}_S,t)) \|^2 dt.$$</p>

<p>For the purpose of discussing wave/particle duality and motivating quantum physics there are three takeaways from this experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The presence of a detector at the slit affects the outcome of the experiment. We avoid interpreting what this means.</li>
  <li>With no detector on the slit, the light behaves like a wave because of the wave interference pattern.</li>
  <li>With a detector on the slit, the light behaves like a particle, since the distribution is what you would get if your photon was like a ball that goes through either Slit 1 or Slit 2 with equal probability.</li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is the note produced by an open organ pipe sweeter then that produced by a closed organ pipe?  </p>

<p>The answer given was:  </p>

<p>""The note produced by an open organ pie consists of both odd and even hapmonics but the note produced by a closed organ pipe consists of only odd harmonics. Due to the presence of <strong>larger</strong> number of overtones or harmonics, the note produced by an open organ pipe is is sweeter.""   </p>

<p>I disagree with the answer. If we assume two organ pipes of the same length $\ l$ the first one open and the second one closed, the harmonics of both the organ pipes are:   </p>

<p><strong>Open:</strong> $\frac{v}{2l}$, $\frac{2v}{2l}$,$\frac{3v}{2l}$, etc with a difference of $\frac{v}{2l}$ between successive harmonics</p>

<p><strong>Closed:</strong> $\frac{v}{4l}$, $\frac{3v}{4l}$,$\frac{5v}{4l}$, etc with a difference of $\frac{v}{2l}$ between successive harmonics.  </p>

<p>In both cases the harmonics form an AP with the same common difference. Just the first term is different. Then how can we say that the open organ pipe would have larger no. of overtones? According to this logic the very statement that the note produced by an open organ pipe is sweeter then that produced by a closed organ pipe seems false.  Where am I going wrong?</p>

  <p>Carnot's theorem states:</p>

  <li>Every Carnot <strong>heat</strong> engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient, regardless of the working substance employed or the
  operation details.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What I do not understand is the following. The theorem is derived for an <strong>heat</strong> engine since it regards the efficiency of a heat engine.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in some textbooks it is said that the theorem is valid for a generic <strong>engine</strong> (also a refrigerator or another type) and that it is equivalent to state that, calling $T_{C}$ the temperature of hot reservoir, $T_ {F}$ the temperature of cold reservoir, $Q_F$ the heat exchanged with the cold reservoir and $Q_C$ the heat exchanged with the hot reservoir.</p>

<p>$$\frac{Q_F}{T_F}+\frac{Q_C}{T_C} \leq 0  \, \,\ \,\,\,\,\mathrm{or \, eqivalently} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, Q_C \leq -\frac{T_C}{T_F} Q_F \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>(Which comes from $\Delta S_{universe}&gt;0$)</p>

<p>From here Raveau's diagrams are drawn, where only some regions are allowed, and in particular in $I$ there are <strong>heat engines</strong> and in $IV$ there are <strong>refrigerators</strong>. But this assumes that Carnot theorem is valid for a refrigerator too.</p>

<p>Some notes about a quantum state (like the simplest generic qubit) wrote that we express it as a linear combination of states, id est</p>

<p>$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha\ |0\rangle  + \beta\ |1\rangle$$</p>

<p>because a nonlinear one would, for example, violate causality.</p>

<p>So I am asking: is that the only reason? Why would it violate causality? Is there any other strange exotic application? (After all, if some managed to apply the fractional calculus somewhere, why not the nonlinear combinations of states I say...)</p>

"276333","If a particle interaction does not violate conservation laws will it occur?","<p>In particle physics their are several quantities (charge, baryon number, lepton number, momentum, and energy) which are conserved by all 4 fundamental interactions. Often in textbooks etc. their are questions asking whether a particular interaction can occur. e.g.
$$A +B \rightarrow X+Y$$
I usually do such questions by seeing if any of the above conservations laws have been violated, and if they haven't stating that it can occur. But this got me thinking, is it in fact a necessary and sufficient condition  for an interaction to have a non-zero probability of occurring  that these conservations laws are satisfied? Or are their interactions that have a zero probability but do satisfy these conservations law? Please can you explain your answer.</p>

"276334","Motivating supersymmetry from Deligne's theorem on tensor categories","<p>There are crucially two different incarnations of supersymmetry, whose conflation is the source of much confusion in public discussion. </p>

<p>On the one hand there is ""low-energy"" supersymmetry. This has traditionally been motivated by appeal to naturalness of the standard model, gauge-coupling unification, and dark matter candidates. It is this version of supersymmetry which is being put under high pressure from current experimental data, leading people to recognize that arguments via naturalness etc. are not as solid as they may have felt.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is ""high-energy"" supersymmetry, namely supergravity. By nature of high energies, this is much less accessible to experiment, if at all, but it is this version of supersymmetry that actually has solid theoretical motivation. </p>

<p>For instance what string theory actually predicts as a mathematical result is that combining the assumption of strings with the existence of fermions, hence considering what was originally called the ""spinning string"", miraculously implies local spacetime supersymmetry, i.e. supergravity. On the other hand, the reduction of this solid prediction of high energy supersymmetry to low energy supersymmetry needs to <em>assume</em> by hand that the spacetime vacuum is a KK-compactification on Calabi-Yau fibers, or similar. This is not something that the theory predicts, this is something imposed by hand. What the theory predicts is high energy supersymmetry. (This is well known, and yet it is frequently forgotten in public discussion.)</p>

<p>But even without the assumption of strings, there are good formal arguments for high energy supersymmetry. The most popular among these is the Coleman-Mandula theorem combined with the Haag–Lopuszanski–Sohnius theorem. This says that if you believe that fundamentally (i.e. at high energy, small distances) spacetime symmetry should be ""unified with internal symmetry"" then supersymmetry is one possibility to achieve this.</p>

<p>Popular as this argument is, it has its weaknesses. First of all you might not buy into the assumption that spacetime symmetry needs to be unified with internal symmetry. Even if you do, the theorem only says that supersymmetry is one way to achieve this.</p>

<p>But actually there is a little-known theorem by a very famous mathematician which has considerably stronger implications as to the motivation of high energy supersymmetry. This is <em>Deligne's theorem on tensor categories</em>.</p>

<p>Paraphrased to the realm of particle physics, the theorem says the following, informally: Given any reasonable choice of elementary particle species, then 1) there always is a spacetime symmetry group G such such that these particles arise in the Wigner classification of elementary particles transforming under G, and 2) the class of spacetime groups arising this way are precisely the (algebraic) super-groups. (As opposed to, say, more non-commutative groups etc.)</p>

<p>More exposition of this is in the recent <em>PhysicsForums Insights</em> article</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/supersymmetry-delignes-theorem/"" rel=""nofollow"">Why supersymmetry? Because of Deligne's theorem</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, Deligne's theorem is from 2002, hence it is not really new anymore. But it seems essentially unknown among physicists. I had known about if for a while, and appreciated its implication for high energy supersymmetry. But it was only due to the recent increase of confused public discussion on the motivations for supersymmetry that I began to think that this theorem might deserve more public exposition among physicists.</p>

<p>But I am wondering: Did anyone else, in the physics community, point to Deligne's theorem on tensor categories before, as a motivation for fundamental (high energy) supersymmetry? What would be references?</p>

"276355","Extension of unitary operator in subsystem to complete system","<p>I have a question on an exercise 2.67 in Nielson and Chuang.  This is the exercise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>
  <strong><em>Exercise 2.67</em></strong> <em>Suppose $\:V\:$ is a Hilbert  space with a subspace $\:W$.  Suppose $\: U : W \rightarrow V\:$ is a linear operation which preserves inner products, that is, for any $\:|w_{1}\rangle\:$ and  $\:|w_{2}\rangle\:$ in $\:W$,
  $$

<p>I'm not being able to figure out how to
a) prove it
b) construct the extension U' for a given U in a specific problem.</p>

<p>Everywhere I search people just refer to the problem or say it's trivial, without giving any direction.</p>

<p>$U|w_{1,2}\rangle=|v_{1,2}\rangle$ so $\langle v_2|v_1\rangle=\langle w_2|U^{\dagger}U|w_1\rangle=\langle w_2|w_1\rangle$.  And so the unitary operator U' that preserves the inner product for the v's ( $\langle w_2|U^{'\dagger}U'|w_1\rangle=\langle w_2|w_1\rangle$) should be related to U.  </p>

"276358","Scattering projectile particle with defined momentum","<p>When studying collisions in quantum mechanics you are interested in finding trough the cross section's data the expression of the probability current density $j$ which is strictly connected to your system's wave function $\psi (x,t)$ that you want to determine. Now in the treatment of the problem (in the lecture notes I'm reading, and also in standard books) I often deal with projectile particles with defined momentum $p_k=\hbar k$ prepared (I quote) ""at spacial infinity in the remote past"". How can I deal with particles with defined momentum, and therefore a sort of real physical system described by monochromatic plane waves? I have made some guesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>the fact that the particles are prepared at spacial infinity and in the remote past suggests me that I can contruct a wave packet arbitrarily peaked around a value $k$ at its origin (thus at $-\infty$). But due to time evolution when my projectile reaches the scattering center it will be no more peaked around a single value, so what is the point? I know that, for a packet like a Gaussian one, the time evolution leaves the mean value $&lt;p&gt;_t=p_0$, with $p_0$ initial value of $p$ associated with my initial condition $\psi_0$; is thus the $p_k$ of my question the mean value of my packet?</li>
<li>In physical situations (I had this hint from my lecture notes) I have a beam of nearly identical particles generated in the laboratory, and thus I have a discrete set of eigenvalues of my energy $w_k$ and the corresponding eigenfunctions are thus normalizable and non degenerate because of the boundary condition of having my particles confined in the laboratory. But the linear dimensions of my room let me approximate the values of my energy with a rather continuous spectrum and thus approximate my normalizable eigenfunctions $\phi_k$ with non normalizable plane waves. At this point what is the formal procedure I make to treat something normalizable as it's not?</li>

"276381","Hilbert's Electron Hotel, or Problems With The Dirac Sea","<p>Dirac's equation allows an infinite amount of solutions with negative energies of arbitrarily large absolute value.
This means that the vacuum as used in quantum electrodynamics, i.e. an absence of particles, is not a useful concept, since adding a single electron (or finitely many) to it leads to a system without a thermodynamically stable configuration of minimal energy.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, the Dirac Sea is introduced: Instead of a vacuum without any particles, we have a vacuum where all states of negative energy are filled with electrons and all states of positive energy are empty.
Pauli's exclusion princible (supposedly) forbids electrons from moving to a state with lower energy, since they are all already filled.
The Dirac Sea is of course a valuable concept, since it led to the discovery of antimatter and pair creation and annihilation:
If an electron is excited from the Dirac Sea into a state of positive energy, it leaves behind a hole/positron as well; if an electron moves from a positive-energy state to an empty Dirac Sea state, the electron and the hole/positron are annihilated.</p>

<p>However, when viewed in connection with the Paradox of Hilbert's Hotel, it seems to me that the idea breaks down.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, if we add an electron to the vacuum, this is akin to a newly arriving guest to a full Hilbert's Hotel.
If all guests move to the room with the next-higher room number, the new guest can still get a room.
In the same manner, all electrons in the Dirac Sea could move to a state with lower energy, leaving space for the added electron to move into.
This would be single electron annihilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, an electron could move from the Dirac Sea into a state with positive energy without leaving a hole/positron behind.
This would be single electron creation.</p></li>
<li><p>More extremely, the Dirac Sea still does not guarantee a minimum energy configuration:
All electrons could simply move at the same time to a state of lower energy without violating Pauli's exclusion principle, leading to a state of lower total energy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I see some possible objections against this argumentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The theory breaks down at high energies (high meaning the absolute value). This is something of a cop out.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed mechanisms violate well-established conservation laws.
However, I think if we only allow the creation/annihilation of electron pairs with equal spin (meaning a spin-change of one), all conservation laws except the conservation of charge could be rescued if photons with an appropriate energy, momentum, etc. are emitted.
In addition, this is still something of a cop out since many conservation laws can be derived from their respective theories (like the conservation of momentum from Newton's Axioms/Noether's Theorem, etc.).
I am not too sure on this point, though.</p></li>

Surely adding any layer to the outside of a radiator will reduce its ability to radiate heat.</p>

<p>If you get two empty tins (bean tins) with silvered surfaces inside and out. Then paint the outside of one of them matt black. Then fill both with boiling water and pop a lid on with a thermometer in each and observe the rates of temperature decline. You will notice that the black tin cools at a faster rate. I don't understand why. The heat is now transferring faster through the silvered metal of the blackened tin before it even reaches the black paint.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

"276420","Binary satellite system to approach low orbit","<p>After hearing the exciting news about discovery of a new earth like planet, It is becoming more of an urgent need to come up with more efficient ways of sending probes to investigate new planets.  </p>

<p>One idea is to deploy a command module in the orbit of the planet and dangle the probe by a very thin light-weight cable a few hundred kilometers long. Or have the prob and command module rotating around their CG which stays in the orbit.<br>
By saving on the fuel needed to send the prob to surface and later retrieve it they can add to the payload or travel farther.<br>
The length of the cable could be designed to let probe almost land and stay stationary on the surface for a few seconds to do sampling and data gathering.<br>
In effect the probe path would be like the path of the air-valve on a bicycle tire while the bicycle is ridden.<br>

Now using finite differences I get to the following:
$$C^{i+1}_{j,k} =C^i_{j,k}+\Delta t \biggr[ (D+D')\biggr[\frac{C^i_{j+1,k}-2C^i_{j,k}+C^i_{j-1,k}}{(\Delta x)^2}+\frac{C^i_{j,k+1}-2C^i_{j,k}+C^i_{j,k-1}}{(\Delta y)^2}\biggr]-u_x \frac{C^i_{j,k} -C^i_{j-1,k}}{\Delta x} - u_y \frac{C^i_{j,k} -C^i_{j,k-1}}{\Delta y}\biggr]$$

<p>I tried two approaches for this problem but don't know which one is correct.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>METHOD $1$:</strong></p>

<p>Effective Gravity:$(F/m-g)$ upwards where F is electrostatic interaction force between the charges and also due the electric field on charge q.</p>

<p>Now minimum velocity at top to loop the complete circle is $\sqrt{5(a)R}$.</p>

<p>[See <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/203666/vertical-circular-motion-tension-and-velocity"">Vertical Circular motion - Tension and velocity</a> ]</p>

<p>Applying this formula I get $v=\sqrt{5*(50)*0.5}m/s$ [since $a=(-kqQ/R^2+qE-mg)/m$ which I calculated to be $50 m/s^2$]</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>METHOD $2$</strong></p>

<p>Tension in thread is minimum when thread is in lowest point.For T=0 at lowest point the velocity at lowest point should be $\sqrt{37}m/s$ [using $mV^2/R=kqQ/R^2+qE+T-mg$]</p>

<p>Using work energy theorem between lowest and highest point on circle $W_{total}=\triangle K$</p>

<p>or $qE(2R)-mg(2R)=(1/2)mv^2-(1/2)mV^2$ where $v$ is the required velocity and $V$ is the velocity at bottom.</p>

<p>After calculation $v=\sqrt{61}m/s=7.81 m/s$</p>

<p>Both the methods are giving different answers.I'm confused which one is correct.Please guide me.</p>

"276447","AI Jump Arc Calculation","<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my question, I will try to keep it as concise as I can.</p>

<p>I am making a 2D-platformer game. I am in the process of programming AI that can intelligently traverse their terrain. AI are able to jump, in a fashion similar to many other 2D-platformers:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the AI jumps, it is given a fixed initial Y-Velocity.</li>
<li>The AI has a flexible time where it may ignore gravity to give it a variable jump height/air time. (This mimics the way that the player is able to jump, where the player character may jump higher if the player holds down the jump-button longer.)</li>
<li>After this time expires, or the AI ""releases the jump button"", gravity begins to affect the jump arc. The acceleration rate of gravity is also constant.</li>
<li>The velocity on the X-axis is constant once the jump starts, but may be set up to a maximum prior to the jump starting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: How would an AI find the minimum amount of time that it will have to ""hold down its jump button"" to clear an expanse between a starting jump point, and a desired target?</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>I don't know how helpful the following is, but decided that it would be better to include more rather than less info.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial Y-Velocity = 600 px/sec</li>
<li>Gravity Acceleration = 2100 (px/sec)/sec</li>
<li>Maximum X-Velocity = 220 px/sec</li>
<li>Maximum amount of time that the AI's Y-Velocity is unaffected by gravity = .2 secs</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to emphasize that the area where I really struggle is that the process of the jump may be broken up into two parts: the first part is linear, and the latter part is parabolic. The linear part is also variable and in the control of the AI, the latter part is not in the control of the AI and simply follows the parabolic path of the physical forces of the game, so the real question that the AI needs to answer is, ""How long do I hold down my 'jump button'?""</p>

<p>I've spoofed a mock-up of what the arc of the jump looks like to visualize the issue.</p>

<p>“Every quark in the universe does not attract every other quark in the above distance independent manner, since color-confinement implies that the strong force acts without distance-diminishment only between pairs of quarks, and that in collections of bound quarks (i.e., hadrons), the net color-charge of the quarks essentially cancels out, resulting in a limit of the action of the forces. Collections of quarks (hadrons) therefore appear nearly without color-charge, and the strong force is therefore nearly absent between those hadrons except that the cancellation is not quite perfect. A residual force remains (described below) known as the residual strong force. This residual force does diminish rapidly with distance, and is thus very short-range (effectively a few femtometers). It manifests as a force between the ""colorless"" hadrons, and is sometimes known as the strong nuclear force or simply nuclear force.”</p>

"276464","Can we justify the Principle of Least Action through considerations of symmetry?","<p>The Principle of Least Action is quite important in Classical Mechanics and Classical Field Theory as it asserts which is the path of time evolution the system follows. In Classical Mechanics, for simplicity, it can be states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let a classical system be given whose configuration manifold is $Q$ and whose lagrangian is $L : TQ\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$. The time evolution of the system between instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ is the path $\gamma : [t_1,t_2]\to Q$ which makes the action functional</p>
  
  <p>$$S[\gamma]=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(\gamma(t),\gamma'(t),t)dt$$</p>
  
  <p>stationary to first order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This principle is very important as it directly affords the equations of motion and furthermore, provide as one <em>immediate</em> corolary the important result of Noether's Theorem, which is heavily connected to the study of symmetries.</p>

<p>Now, it is usually hard to justify the principle, other than saying: ""we use it because it works"". </p>

<p>On the other hand, in Classical Mechanics, it is possible to ""arrive at the principle"" by taking another route, starting from D'Alembert's principle.</p>

<p>My question here is: can we starting from considerations of transformations and symmetries justify the Principle of Least Action? Can we justify and arrive at this principle just by dealing with transformations and symmetries?</p>

When one brings in the energy band picture, then it is claimed that work function is equal to fermi level, and is the energy required to remove an electron from the crystal's influence and bring it to the surface of the crystal.
Are the two work functions different in nature?

"276502","Evanescent waves and photon tunneling","<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I am reading about near-field heat transfer. Generally this phenomena is describes using (classical) Maxwell equations. In vacuum heat transfer from a body A to a body B such that $T_A &gt; T_B$ happens through radiation. If the distance between these bodies is smaller than the wavelength of the blackbody radiation of A (more specifically smaller than the wavelength given by Wien's displacement law) heat transfer is enhanced by several orders of magnitudes.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic waves have to cross two interfaces before being absorbed in body B. Namely the A-Vacuum (A-V) interface and the Vacuum-B (V-B) interface. For some materials you can get total reflection at the A-V interface. In this situation an evanescent wave. The latter travels parallel to the A-V interface and decay exponentially perpendicularly with respect the A-V interface. The Poynting vector is zero in the perpendicular direction. If now the V-B interface is close enough (and parallel to A-V) to the evanescent wave, an EM wave can be observed in B with non-zero energy density. The energy passed through the vacuum gap even though the Poynting vector is zero (perpendicularly to A-V).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>The mathematics is extremely similar to the tunnelling of, for instance, electrons in quantum mechanics. In some books/paper I saw people referring to this phenomenon as photon tunnelling. Is this energy transfer completely described with classical equations photon tunnelling? Is then tunnelling related to wave mechanics and NOT strictly to quantum mechanics?</p>

In <em>Mathematical Aspects of Quantum Field Theory</em> page 107-108 it is stated that for every $s,t\in \frac 1 2 \mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ there is a $(2s+1)(2t+1)$ dimensional complex irreducible representation of $SL(2,\mathbb C)$ (and that any irreducible representation is one of these). As for $s,t=\frac 1 2$ this gives rise to a spin bundle (associated to a spin frame bundle) with fibre $F$, a complex vector space of dimension $4$ (i.e. $\mathbb C^4$), this means that a one-electron state is a section of this bundle, after which we make the assumption of this bundle being trivial so that such sections correspond to functions $\mathbb R^{1,3}\to \mathbb C^4$. </p>

<p>In cricket, a spin bowler imparts rotations on the ball at the point of release and thereby seeks to deceive their opponent (the batter) through either (i) the trajectory of the ball through the air; or (ii) the ball's behaviour once it comes into contact with the playing surface. [The ball will, as a general rule, be delivered at an initial velocity of 80-90kph and will travel c. 15 metres after it is delivered prior to bouncing, and a further 3 metres before reaching the position in which the batter is initially situated]</p>

<p>In the article, a cricket ball manufacturer states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can change the construction of the core so that it is more conducive to spin bowling, by weighting the core more heavily in the middle. It has an effect like an ice skater on the rink: when she spins with her arms wide, she spins slowly, and as she brings her arms in, she accelerates. All she has done is bring her weight in, which has enabled her to spin faster. </p>

"276528","Error propagation results in unusually massive output error","<p>I've got a system used to measure the density and static head of a liquid by using two pressure sensors, with one of them being a known fixed distance vertically above the other. By measuring the pressure difference between the two sensors, the liquid density can be calculated by using (<a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/hydrostatic-pressure-water-d_1632.html"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>):</p>

<p>$$\rho = \frac{P_b - P_t}{g \Delta h}$$</p>

<p>Where $\rho$ is the density, $P_t$ and $P_b$ are the top and bottom pressure sensors respectively, $g$ is gravity and $\Delta h$ is the fixed height between the two sensors.</p>

<p>The static head of the fluid can then be calculated by using:</p>

<p>$$h = \frac{P_b}{\rho g}$$</p>

<p>By substituting the first equation into the second, this can be simplified to:</p>

<p>$$h = \frac{P_b \Delta h}{P_b - P_t}$$</p>

<p>Regarding units, as long as the pressure units are consistent, the output height will have the same units as $\Delta h$.</p>

<p>I'm using this last equation to try and work out the error in my final height measurement based on the errors in the sensors. I'm using <a href=""http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/~mmp/labs/error/e2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a> for reference. The pressure sensors that I have have an accuracy of 1.5% of the full scale span (20kPa), giving an error of $\pm0.3kPa$. If we consider the bottom half of the fraction, the two values are added together, so the propagated error would be $\delta_1=\sqrt{0.3^2 + 0.3^2} = \pm0.4243kPa$. For the top half of the fraction, the sensor value is multiplied by a known constant (0.2m), so the propagated error would be $\delta_2 = 0.3 \times 0.2 = \pm0.06kPa$.</p>

<p>Now, in order to calculate the final error of the two parts of the fraction divided by each other, I need some actual measured values. For the purposes of this question, we'll use the following values: $P_b=20kPa$, $P_t=18kPa$, $\Delta h=0.2m$. The calculated height value is therefore:</p>

<p>$$h=\frac{20\times0.2}{20-18} = \frac{4\pm0.06}{2\pm0.4243} = 2\pm?$$ </p>

<p>The total error would therefore be:</p>

<p>$$\delta_{total}=h\sqrt{\left(\frac{\delta_1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\delta_2}{2}\right)^2} = 2\sqrt{\left(\frac{0.06}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{0.4243}{2}\right)^2} = \pm0.4254m$$</p>

<p>This results in a measured height of $2\pm0.4254m$, which is a massive error, almost 25%, which seems way to big considering the sensors are only 1.5%. Is there anything wrong with the way I'm propagating the error through my equation?</p>

<p>Mg(s) has Ar value of 24.3g so the number of moles would be 2.60g / 24.3g = 0.107mol</p>

"276542","Definition of temperature: ""absolute"" temperature and linear relations between temperature and thermometric properties","<p>I'm confused about the definition of temperature, and I would like to make some points clearer since I did not find an explanation.</p>

<p>Firstly I have heard of three adjectives regarding temperature (scales): <strong>empirical</strong>, <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>thermodynamical</strong>.</p>

<p>I think I understood the difference between empirical and thermodynamical, but what is exactly meant by <strong>absolute</strong>? </p>

<p>Is this the same as ""indipendent from the particular system used to measure temperature"", or does this adjective indicates that the scale can only have positive numbers, with the $0 K$ placed, indeed, at <strong>absolute zero</strong>?</p>

<p>For example, <strong>ideal</strong> gas constant volume thermometer gives absolute temperature, because the measurement is not affected by the use of different gases, as long as they are ideal? Or is it because in the definition
$$T=\mathrm{lim}_{p_0-&gt;0} 273.16 \frac{p}{p_0} \, K$$</p>

<p>it is implicit that $T=0K$ is a temperature that can be reached only if $p=0 Pa$ (a limiting condition) and hence the scale has the zero in a very particular place, that cannot be reached?</p>

<hr>

<p>My second question is about the ideal gas thermometer itself: in the previous definition it is used the fact that, ""for an ideal gas $T \propto p$ at contant volume"". That's how textbook introduces the ideal gas thermometer. </p>

<p>What I do not get is: how can we use the relation  $T \propto p$ in ideal gases before even knowing what is temperature, i.e. to define (which means to measure) the temperature itself?</p>

<p>I do not get if the relation $T \propto p$ is <strong>imposed</strong> by the definition of temperature, for make things easier or if there is something behind it that guarantees that, before knowing how to even measure temperature, the temperature is proportional to pressure at constant volume. This last option does not makes a lot of sense, so if this is the case I surely misunderstood the reasoning behind the use of ideal gas thermometer.</p>

<p>And this holds also for any thermometric property $X$, where the relation to get the temperature $\theta$ from the property $X$ itself, say $\theta(X)$ is assumed to be linear, which means $$\theta(X)=C \, X$$</p>

<p>Is this really an <strong>assumption</strong>, in the sense that it is imposed to be true, or is in some way known before the definition of $\theta$? </p>

<p>I have a very strong feeling I'd go straight down to the bottom of the pool, as if there wasn't any water in it, i'd hit the concrete and break my legs, sure, but from <em>practical</em> point of view, would it be the <em>same</em> as free-falling?

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ue5Xi.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ue5Xi.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What I don't understand is that the formula for an observers perceived time, $\Delta t'$, of the clock is derived from the Pythagorean theorem which only works because the light is being reflected in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the clock (from the clock's point of view). If the clock reflected the light in the same direction as it was itself moving, that is in the animation above the clock would be flipped 90 degrees ""laying down"", then it would still be a clock because it would still have a fixed period but I don't see how one would derive the same result for how a bystander perceives the clock:  </p>

<p>$$\Delta t' = \dfrac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$$</p>

<p>I am asking this because in the example I've seen of length contraction, the clock was moving in the same direction as the light was being reflected, but in the derivation of the equation of the contraction effect they still used the formula for time dilation, which was derived when the clock was ""standing"" as in the animation above.</p>

"276575","Energy balance for convective drying vs. boiling. Energy required to transport water into dry air","<p>OK, so. Huge debate with a co-worker. Help!</p>

<p>The fundamental question is which scenario requires more energy on a unit mass basis:</p>

<p>a) Boiling water in a closed vessel (typical boiler). 
b) Flowing 0% RH dry gas over a the surface of a pool of water to continuously remove water vapor (never reaching saturation vapor pressure). </p>

<p>My colleague believes that scenarios ""a"" and ""b"" will require the same amount of energy. I believe that scenario ""a"" will require significantly more heat. In scenario ""b"" we have a concentration gradient. Water should preferentially leave the surface of the pool in favor of the entering the dry air.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate your thoughts. Also, is there a simple way to prove this with thermodynamics? The math is rusty.  I do have access to EES and am pretty familiar with it if that would provide a good way to go about it. </p>

"276587","$\pi$, $\sigma^\pm$ components with no magnetic field?","<p>This question stems from  <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/276366/the-definition-of-a-pi-polarized-photon"">The definition of a $\pi$ polarized photon?</a></p>

<p>In the presence of a magnetic field we can define a $\sigma^-$ polarized photon as one with $j_z=-m\hbar$, a $\sigma^+$ one with $j_z=m\hbar$ and a $\pi$ photon one with $j_z=0$.</p>

<p>A $\sigma^+$ ($\sigma^-$) photon traveling along the $z$ direction (i.e. parallel to the magnetic field) appears as a left (right) circularly polarized wave. But the same photons traveling in the $x$ or $y$ direction appear as linear (see <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g8O-qhbjF88C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=%CF%80-component%20parallel%20to%20the%20z-axis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UBzSlUDe3A&amp;sig=HBEFZhuEWSK7AlL1iBlf-EpynZk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2o__rpt_OAhXFDMAKHVP7ADIQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%CF%80-component%20parallel%20to%20the%20z-axis&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). A $\pi$ photon has a polarization parallel to the magnetic field and can't propagate along the magnetic field.</p>

<p>From this it is clear that when observing in the $x$ direction you will only see linearly polarized photons and when in the $z$ direction only circularly polarized photons.</p>

<p>Is the same true when there is no magnetic field present or does something change in the analysis meaning we can see linearly polarized photons and circularly polarized photons in both directions? If so what and if not why not?</p>

"276599","Quantum fields and condensates","<p>From my fairly naive understanding of quantum field theory (QFT), a <em>quantum field</em> $\hat{\phi}$ is an operator field, i.e. for each spacetime point $x^{\mu}$, $\hat{\phi}(x)$ is an operator acting on the corresponding Fock space of particle states. Then, at least in the free-field case,  $\hat{\phi}(x)$ acting on the vacuum state, $\lvert 0\rangle$ creates a particle in a given single particle state. As far as I understand it, one can heuristically interpret this as a quantised excitation in the quantum field, and in this sense, all particles of a given species are simply excitations (the so-called <em>quanta</em>) of their corresponding quantum field.</p>

<p>Now, here comes my question: I have read that if a given field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev), that is $$\langle 0\rvert\hat{\phi}(x)\lvert 0\rangle\neq 0$$ then this is referred to as a <em>condensate</em>, and furthermore can be interpreted as a collection of field quanta all residing in the vacuum state.</p>

<p>Why is it that, when a quantum field as a non-zero (i.e. it forms a condensate), it can be interpreted as a collection of particles in the vacuum state?$^{(\ast)}$ I thought a quantum field is simply as I described early - not a collection of particles, but an operator field from which particles can be created (from the vacuum state) at each spacetime point?!</p>

<hr>

<p>$^{(\ast)}$ I have been reading about inflation and the subsequent reheating process. According to what I've read, at the end of inflation, the inflaton field forms a condensate, oscillating about the minimum of its potential, which is interpreted as a collection of zero momentum particles in a single quantum state.</p>

"276602","If free space impedance is real, why is the electric field not attenuated?","<p>Why does vacuum have a nonzero characteristic impedance towards electromagnetic radiation?
Intrinsic impedance given by $\eta=\sqrt{j\omega\mu / (\sigma +j \omega \epsilon)}$. It gives slope of transformation of $\mathbf E$  to $\mathbf H$ and vice versa.
Here $\eta$ is complex.
And in this expression real part is the cause of attenuation and imaginary part is the cause of phase shift.</p>

<p>In case of free space since $\sigma = 0$, we have $\eta = \sqrt{j\omega\mu / j\omega\epsilon} = \sqrt{\mu / \epsilon}$, which is real.
This suggests presence of resistive part in intrinsic impedance which means there should be attenuation. Also curiosity is how free space can offer resistance and however, the expression for electric field in plane wave $\mathbf E = E_0 \exp(wt-\beta z)$ where $\beta =2 {\pi}/{\lambda}   $ and  $\lambda  $: wavelength </p>

<p>suggests constant electric field. How can we reconcile the real impedance of space with the expression for electric field, which has no attenuation?</p>

<p>$ F_f = 6 \pi r \eta v$</p>

<p>where $ r $ is the radio of the sphere, $ \eta $ the viscosity of the fluid, $v$ the velocity of the sphere</p>

<p>Equaling the two forces I obtain:</p>

<p>$ \eta = \frac{2}{9} \frac{r^2 g ( \rho _1 - \rho_2 )}{v_t}  $</p>

<p>where $ v_t $ is now the terminal velocity</p>

<p>I believe that exists another force due the walls of the tube, since when I drop balls with similar densities but with very little diameter differences, the balls achieve quite different terminal velocities. But I would like to know how can I describe this force based in the geometry of the tube</p>

<p>I believe this is true because if I use the last equation, I obtain viscosities very different from the literature</p>

<p>For example the water density is  $ 1000 kg/m^3  $, the density of the ball is $ 2400 kg/m^3 $, the diameter of the sphere is 0.01581 m, and the diameter of the tube is 0.016 m, so:</p>

<p>$ \eta = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(0.01581 m/2)^2 (9.8 m/s^2) ( 2400 kg/m^3 - 1000 kg/m^3 )}{0.000802 m/s} = 237.55 pa*s $</p>

<p>Considering that the water was at room temperature the answer should be 0.00089 pa*s . So there is a lot of difference</p>

<p>I am not even sure if this law is correct, if I consider the correct answer, then:</p>

<p>$ v_t= \frac{2}{9} \frac{(0.01581 m/2)^2 (9.8 m/s^2) ( 2400 kg/m^3 - 1000 kg/m^3 )}{0.00089 pa*S} = 213.79 m/s $</p>

<p>That is a very high velocity in my opinion.</p>

<p>I would like to deduce the full equation, but I am not sure if I am making the correct assumptions or if I missing something important, I would appreciate any suggestions, thanks in advance</p>

  <p>If we hop in a spaceship that can go 90% the speed of light, we are now going through spacetime with only 10% dedicated to the time dimension which means time slows down for us (relative to slower moving observers) by an equivalent amount.

Not only that, anything at that speed will always move that speed relative to an observer slower than that speed. My questions then are, is there anything that will always be stationary relative to an observer? If light is the cosmological constant of speed, is there a cosmological constant of rest? And if so, would that have infinite mass? And exist wholly in time and not in space? I'm not a mathematician or a physicist, but I do like thinking and would love to hear some answers to these. </p>

"276678","Does 'Snicko' really work? - Sound generated by object passing without touching","<p>(Those that don't understand cricket, please ignore this context, I will get to the physics...)</p>

<p>England are playing Pakistan at Lords and a decision has once again been overturned based on evidence from the 'snickometer'. (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/cricket/36893155"" rel=""nofollow"">see over 1.4</a> ) It's always bothered me slightly that there seems to be a possibility that what this detects is not the ball hitting the bat (or glove in this case) but could just be the two passing very close.</p>

<p>When two objects collide in air, e.g. a ball hitting a bat, there is typically a noise and a deviation in the motion of one or both of the objects. In cricket, these collisions can be very fine as the ball passes the edge of the bat and detecting them is important to the game itself. The primary detection devices for the ball hitting the bat are the eyes and ears of the umpire, but in recent years the teams have been able to ask for decisions made in this way to be reviewed by an umpire with technological assistance. One of these pieces of technology, the 'snickometer', or 'Snicko' detects and enhances the sound of the ball supposedly hitting the bat. My doubt is whether this is fully accurate or whether Skicko fails to distinguish between contact and a very-near-miss.</p>

<p>My thoughts run something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>The sound we wish to detect is caused by the vibration in the surface of a bat and/or ball when they collide.</li>
<li>Sound, as a pressure wave, could also be caused by the compression of air as the ball approaches very closely to the edge of the bat, and rarefaction as it leaves the vicinity of the bat.</li>
<li>How much do these sounds differ and how can they be differentiated by a sound detection device?</li>
</ol>

<p>The first thing that springs to mind is that the vibrations in the case of the bat and ball colliding are plural, and thus will show for longer in the detection device. A perfectly spherical ball passing a bat would only cause a single rise-fall-return change in pressure. However, a cricket ball is not a perfect sphere, it has a raised, stitched seam; this creates miniature ridges that would vary the compression between the ball and bat-edge as it passed.</p>

<p>So, is my knowledge and understanding sound? (pun unintended but left anyway)
If it is, how would we, or how does Snicko, differentiate between 'ball hitting bat' and 'ball passing very closely past bat'?</p>

"276685","Torques acting on a decelerating box - Maximum height of the box so it does not tip over","<p>A square based box (length and width = 1m) lies on a horizontal surface on a train. The train decelerates constantly at 5ms^-2 till it stops. Determine the maximum height of the box so that it does not tip over.</p>

<p>Assumptions: - Box does not slide
             - Equal weight distribution</p>

<p>My answer:
the 2 forces providing rotational torque are 1. weight of box acting on the centre of mass and 2. the horizontal deceleration of the object (5ms^-2) also acting on the centre of mass. 
Taking moments at the pivot point - corner of the box:</p>

<p>Torque of 1. = 9.8M * 1/2 (M=mass of box) </p>

<p>Torque of 2. = -5M * h/2 (h= height of the box) </p>

<p>For the box not to tip:</p>

<p>1.+ 2. = 0 </p>

<p>9.8M * 1/2 = 5M * h/2</p>

<p>9.8 = 5 *h </p>

<p>h= 9.8/5 = 1.96 m </p>

"276694","The entropy of a conversation","<p>Whilst studying Shannon entropy, I came up with a singular idea, which surely someone already analysed, about which I cannot find anything though.
I'm going to explain myself better.</p>

<p>Let's suppose we deal with a string of $N$ characters, written with an alphabet of $k$ letters $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\}$, each one with a probability $p(a_i)$ to appear.
Of course we need</p>

<p>$$\sum_{k = 1}^{k}\ p(a_i) = 1$$</p>

<p>Then here is a simple application: suppose we have a binary alphabet in which ""$1$"" has a probability of $p$ to appear, and ""$0$"" has a probability $1-p$ to appear.
Given a message of $N$ characters, for large $N$,it'll have $N(1-p)$ characters ""$0$"" and $Np$ characters ""$1$"".</p>

<p>Now, the number of the total possible messages is given by</p>

<p>$$\binom{N}{Np}$$</p>

<p>And taking the $\log$ (in base two in this case)m using Stirling we get</p>

<p>$$\log\binom{N}{Np} \approx n\ H(p)$$</p>

<p>Where</p>

<p>$$H(p) = -(p\log_2 p + (1-p)\log_2 p)$$</p>

<p>Now it says: if we deal with $k$ letters, then what we get is the well known <strong>Shannon Entropy</strong></p>

<p>$$H(X) = -\sum_{x = 1}^{k}\ p(x)\log p(x)$$</p>

<p>associated to the distribution $X = \{x, p(x)\}$.</p>

<p>Is it possible to apply this, somehow, in order to find the entropy of a conversation? Or the entropy of a single phrase like ?</p>

<p>(first inductor) L---LSL---LSL---L  (last inductor)</p>

<p>with the last inductor being placed right back next to the first inductor.
So the pairs of inductors are not physically connected together and any energy is transferred by the magnetic fields. The diagram with 6 inductor is shown above.</p>

<p>In the above circuit, does the magnetic field rotate around the circuit (the centre of rotation is in the triangle centre)? Then this means the voltage would oscillate. If not then what happens?</p>

<p>As a strongly related question to the above- what would be the circuit for making a delay line memory based on the above ideas?</p>

<p>Assume somehow that the first inductor is energised and mutual inductance only occurs at the corners of the triangle. Electrons take time to flow in a wire-and it is known they do not travel at the speed of light in a conductor.  You would need to put the ""start inductor"" (the one that is energised) a different distance than the others (which are all the same space apart).</p>

<p>Using 6 inductors is probably simplest , but it would work with multiple inductors in hexagon type shape or nearer to a circular shape. The letter L is an inductor (connected in pairs on on side of the triangle in the diagram above) each arrow happens at a point in time (not all at once) showing the magnetic field rotating. The direction of rotation would depend on the point of view of observer.</p>

<p>Now, when we lift an object (standing on the Earth), we do positive work on the object and so the energy of the object should increase (and our energy should decrease) while the Earth by its gravitational force does negative work on the object and so the energy of the object should decrease (and the energy of the Earth should increase).</p>

"276722","Coupling constants in QFT equations of motion","<p>My question is about the coupling constants that appear in the quantum analogue to the equations of motion in a classical field theory (the Schwinger-Dyson equations). As a concrete example say we have the Lagrangian
$$ \mathcal{L} ~=~ \frac{1}{2} \left ( \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi  - m^2 \phi^2\right ) - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4.$$
Then by a short argument (replace $\phi$ by $\phi+\epsilon$ in the path integral) we should get the vacuum expectation value of the equations of motion vanishing
$$ \left \langle  (\Box + m^2) \phi + \frac{\lambda}{3!} \phi^3 \right \rangle ~=~ 0.$$
We can also include other operators inside the expectation value if we include the proper contact terms. So in the following (so that the equation is not trivial) imagine that the equation of motion is multiplying some operator.</p>

<p>Now my question is for which $m$ and $\lambda$ is this true? The bare coupling constants don't make sense without a corresponding regularization scheme and scale $\Lambda$, which does not appear in this equation in an obvious way. Likewise the renormalized coupling constants are associated with a scale.</p>

<p>It seems to me these equations must be ill defined and there must be some regularization at some point. And I see that the product of fields at the same point in  $\langle\phi^3(x)\rangle$ is problematic. I was wondering if someone could clarify how this equation is interpreted and how the renormalization of the coupling constants comes about?</p>

<p>The point here is: I really can't understand what it means to show that those objects behave as vectors. I mean, by the very definition of $\mathbf{A}$ being $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$ it is already implied, <em>for me</em> that $\mathbf{A}$ is a vector.</p>

<p>Futhermore, since $\mathbf{e}_i$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any three numbers $a^i$ we have that $a^i\mathbf{e}_i$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and hence a vector.</p>

"276753","Is classical electromagnetism conformally invariant? (and a bit of general covariance)","<p>The contest is a flat $4d$ Minkowsky space.
A conformal transformation is a diffeomorphism $\tilde x(x)$ such that the metric transforms as
\begin{equation*}
 \tilde g_{\tilde \mu \tilde \nu} = w^2(x) g_{\mu \nu} 
\end{equation*}
This implies that $ \left| det \left( \frac{\partial \tilde x}{\partial x} \right) \right| = |w| $.<br>
Tensors transform as required by the change of coordinate.<br>
The lagrangian is the usual $\mathscr{L}= -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}-A^{\mu}j_{\mu}$.</p>

<p>Now, IF the tranformed action is 
$ \tilde{S}= \int_{\tilde M} \sqrt{|\tilde g| }\tilde{ \mathscr{L}}\, d\tilde x^0 \cdots d\tilde x^4 \, $ $\,$ , I can show, by hand or by principle, that $\tilde S=S$. <sub> For example because $\mathscr{L}=\tilde{\mathscr{L}}$, and 
$\sqrt{|\tilde g| }$ compensates the change of variables </sub></p>

<p>If that is the case, by doing this I noticed that I never used the fact that the transformation is conformal, and in fact, since the action is an integral of a scalar function, it should be invariant under every general change of coordinates.<br>

"276782","How to read/ use a math book as a physicist?","<p>I’ve recently become interested in some of the mathematics underlying GR and have been looking at several intros into manifolds and differential geometry. When it comes to doing exercises at the end of the chapter, as has been the case in my self-studying of group theory and other areas, I can’t help but find them completely and utterly boring, pointless and unmotivated.</p>

<p>I believe that I have an appreciation for the math, insofar as a lot of times in my physics studies (current undergraduate), when encountering a technique that’s taught superficially/ mechanically, I’m not hesitant to spend hours “convincing” myself why, say the Fourier transform should work, or how geometric algebra tells us about what it means to multiply and divide units, through visual intuitions if not necessarily proofs.</p>

<p>I think my use of math as a source of intuition rather than rigor, though, comprises the source of antagonism in my attempts to study group theory, topology, geometric algebra and many other frameworks for thinking about phenomena from math texts. If one visits Math stack exchange or asks any practicing mathematician, he/ she will advise to look at the problems first and only read the prose as needed later. I find this completely unnerving, as I personally feel it’s reading and thinking about the prose that provides the intuition, and trying to prove things when my physics intuition is already satisfied appears to be a complete waste of time and really just ""for fun"" for people who enjoy it.</p>

<p>While one might argue that doing the exercises and being able to develop proofs are necessary for really understanding a mathematical concept, I’m not convinced that I can’t be a perfectly good physicist capable of understanding, say, GR through the concepts of differential geometry without being able to prove more general things about manifolds. I almost think of there being a distinct mode of thinkings between deriving equations and models in the physics sense, as is often seen in, say, undergraduate thermo/ stat-mech, and the proving of arbitrary results about fields, or the structures of simple groups.</p>

<p>I think fundamentally, perhaps the issue might be that I’m still trying to use math and proofs as a tool for understanding and concept modeling, wherein at the higher levels (differential geometry, topology, etc.) math is almost always taught for mathematicians wherein such applications are an afterthought.</p>

<p>More concretely, I want to ask, is it sane and responsible to read a math text but gloss over or just briefly think about the exercises, skipping those that do not appear interesting? Or does this approach hurt me as a physicist, and I really should read a math book like a mathmatician? More generally, <strong>how should physicists read a math text differently from mathematicians?</strong> What might the best approach be to get the mathematical framework for thinking that I'm looking for, if not through math books for mathematicians?</p>

<p>As a potential solution, while I understand there exists ""X for physicists"", where X is a mathematical discipline, I've generally found that while the prose will contain more physics examples, the exercises are often similar to those one would find in a math text involving proving arbitrary results ""for fun"". Spivak for Category Theory might be a good counterexample, but If anyone has other good  examples, I'd be very grateful to hear them.</p>

<p>As the whole system(the rope and the block) is in equilibrium, so we can say that the system which includes the block and the rope of length $(l-x)$ from the bottom is also in equilibrium.

<p>From the above F.B.D of the differential element of the rope, we get the following set of equations:-
$$T_x+dT_x-T_x-(dm)g=0\implies dT_x=(dm)g\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>Now, to find the differential mass(i.e. $dm$) of the differential element of the rope, we see that as the mass is uniformly distributed over the whole of the rope, so
$$\frac{m}{l}=\frac{dm}{dx}\implies dm=\frac{m}{l}dx$$</p>

<p>On substituting, $dm$ in eq $(1)$, we get
$$dT_x=\left(\dfrac{m}{l}\cdot g\right) dx$$</p>

<p>On, integrating with proper limits we get,
$$\int_{T_0}^{T_x}{dT_x}=\int^{x}_{l}{\left(\dfrac{m}{l}\cdot g\right) dx}\implies T_x-T_0=\dfrac{mg(x-l)}{l}\implies T_x=T_0+\dfrac{mg(x-l)}{l} \\ \implies T_x=Mg-\dfrac{mg(l-x)}{l}$$</p>

"276799","Particle Current Density in GR","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Why is there a <strong>measure</strong> in the definition of particle current density?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong> 
I found myself studying kinetic physics in general relativity, which is fairly well documented in <a href=""http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2011-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">this livingreviews article</a>. Kinetic physics, in this case, refers to switching from ""particle description"" into a ""phase space description"" and formulating general relativistic equations there. The only difference between these two descriptions is that one can think of ""phase space"" as a sort of probability distribution, and it can be used to derive macroscopic (large scale) equations with various approximations in some sense easier.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> In <a href=""http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2011-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">the notes given above</a>, they simply ""define"" particle current density (non-numbered equation) as: </p>

<p>$N^a=-\int_{\mathcal{R}^3} f \sqrt{|g_{ab}|} p^a \frac{dp^1 dp^2 dp^3}{p_0}$</p>

<p>For which $N^0$ is supposedly the ""general relativistic equivalent"" of number density. I find myself disagreeing with this definition (in particular I am fixated on the term $|g_{ab}|$), as I tried solving it for Schwarzschild geometry. </p>

<p>For Schwarzschild geometry:</p>

<p>$N^0=\int_{\mathcal{R}^3} f \cdot (r^2 \sin\theta) \cdot p^0 \frac{dp^1 dp^2 dp^3}{E}$, where $E$ is the covariant energy. </p>

<p>Now I do not understand why there is a factor $\sqrt{|g_{ab}|}$ describing the volume element, because in this case I do not see how $N^0$ can describe density.</p>

<p>The way I understand each term: </p>

<ul>
<li>$f(x^\mu, p^\mu)$ describes the probability <strong>density</strong> </li>
<li>$(r^2 \sin\theta)$ describes the effect of infinitesimal volume element</li>
<li>$p^0$ describes the time dilation in GR</li>
<li>$E$ I dont really understand why this is here but it seems to cancel $p^0$ when in local lorentz frame so why not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now obviously $(r^2 \sin\theta)$ means multiplication by a volume element (easiest to understand as $dV = r^2 \sin\theta dr d\theta d\phi$ in spherical coordinates, forgetting GR for a while). </p>

<p>If $f$ already describes density, why is there an additional volume element?</p>

<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>$f$ is the phase space density</li>
<li>$\sqrt{|g_{ab}|}|$ is the square root of determinant</li>
<li>$p^a$ is the 4-momentum of a given particle.</li>

"276812","W-boson mass eigenstates after electroweak symmetry breaking","<p>A question about how the physical $W^{\pm}_{\mu}, Z_{\mu}, A_{\mu} $ masses arise:</p>

<p>We have the covariant derivative:</p>

<p>$$ D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - \frac{ig}{2}\begin{pmatrix} W^3 &amp; \sqrt{2} w^+ \\ \sqrt{2}W^- &amp; -W^3 \end{pmatrix}  - \frac{ig'}{2} \mathcal{I}B_{\mu}$$</p>

<p>When the symmetry is broken by the Higgs VEV \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ u \end{pmatrix} :</p>

<p>$$ SU(2)_W \times U(1)_Y \rightarrow U(1) $$</p>

<p>And we expand around the vacuum, we obtain, after expanding the kinetic terms $(D_{\mu} \phi)^{\dagger}(D_{\mu} \phi) $</p>

<p>$$ \mathcal{L_{kinetic}} = \frac{g^2}{2}u^2W^+_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + (\frac{-g}{2} W^3_{\mu} + \frac{g'}{2}B_{\mu})(\frac{-g}{2}W^{3\mu} + \frac{g'}{2}B^{\mu}) + ... $$ </p>

<p>When we identify $$W^{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (W^1_{\mu} \pm W^2_{\mu}) $$</p>

<p>We see that the first term gives a term $ \propto (W_1)^2 + (W_2)^2$, which has the form of a mass term. </p>

<p><strong>My question is why we call the charged $W^{\pm}$ bosons the mass eigenstates, but it looks from my naive calculation that the $W_1, W_2$ are also mass eigenstates.</strong></p>

<p>In addition, why does the mass term in the Lagrangian for the charged W bosons take the form:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{g^2u^2}{2} W^+_{\mu} W^{-\mu}$$ instead of the individual $W^+$ and $W^-$ mass terms? Some textbooks mention 'canonical normalization' but I can't find any detailed explaination.</p>

<p>I looked at this previous answer: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/126037/electroweak-interaction-from-w1-mu-w2-mu-w3-mu-b-mu-to"">Electroweak interaction: From $W^{1}_{\mu},W^{2}_{\mu},W^{3}_{\mu},B_{\mu}$ to $W^{\pm},Z_{\mu},A_{\mu}$</a> but it seems like that author had the opposite problem to me.</p>

"276814","Making of the Universe from not The Big Bang","<p>It is well proved by Mr. Hubble that the Universe is expanding in all directions. From this expanding nature it is assumed that at a time in the past whole universe should be in a state like a point which is called the singularity. Then the Big-Bang and so the universe is expanding. No body theoretically proved that it should be singularity from where Big Bang can happen. There is a strong chance that if the whole mass of the universe we live in is confined in a ball as big as few kilometer in diameter then also probably it can produce a Big Bang. The Big Bang theory does say anything about if the universe will go on expanding or start contracting one day in future and it will repeat the Big Bang again. </p>

<p>The law of conservation of mass or energy is a very beautiful and fundamental law of nature which cannot be disobeyed by anything in the nature, not even by a Black Hole. Therefore when there is Black Hole which takes in everything in front of it, on the other end of it there must be a White Hole which must give out everything it received from its opposite end. Black Hole and White Hole must exist in pairs and they are in two different universes. One cannot see both the universes at a time. </p>

<p>Therefore there is another candidate which can produce an expanding universe. That is a giant Black Hole and an equivalent White Hole combination. The Black Hole is far bigger than the black holes already been detected in our universe. The mass that a black hole takes in must come out through the white hole via Worm Hole.  The matter that comes out through the white hole should be in the same state as the matter in the very early stages of the Big Bang. In this concept there are two universes one on the side of giant black hole which is contracting and the other one on the side of white hole which is expanding like us. At the end when the black hole eats up everything of its universe including itself gradually; the Black Hole changes its universe and hence the White Hole; the process continues in opposite direction like a sand clock. Hence contraction and expansion goes on simultaneously in two different universes. </p>

<p>At present what we call the Big Bang it may be the instance when the white hole just opens its mouth. But till date nobody has seen the white hole because it must be at the center of the universe and perhaps we have not reached there yet. In future we may see the giant White Hole at the center of our universe</p>

In page 37, they display the propagators of a closed string. </p>

<p>I also did calculation to verify their results, but my results show that the propagators should contain Heaviside step functions. For example,</p>

<p>$\langle X_L^\mu(\bar z)X_L^\nu(\bar w)\rangle=[\frac{\alpha'}{4}\eta^{\mu\nu}\ln \bar z-\frac{\alpha'}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\ln(\bar z-\bar w)]\theta(\tau-\tau')+[\frac{\alpha'}{4}\eta^{\mu\nu}\ln \bar w-\frac{\alpha'}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\ln(\bar w-\bar z)]\theta(\tau'-\tau),$</p>

<p>$\langle X_R^\mu(z) X_L^\nu(\bar w)\rangle=-\frac{\alpha'}{4}\eta^{\mu\nu}\ln\bar w\,\theta(\tau'-\tau)-\frac{\alpha'}{4}\eta^{\mu\nu}\ln z\,\theta(\tau-\tau')$.</p>

<p>Here, $\tau$ is the time associated with $z$ and $\tau'$ associated with $w$. The reason that there are Heaviside functions is simply that the time ordered product by definition contains Heaviside functions. Please look at my results carefully, and you will find out that if we assume $\tau&gt;\tau'$, my results agree with Blumenhagen et. al.. </p>

"276823","Finding normal and tangential velocity and acceleration for motion along a 3D curve","<p>Basically, I have a major problem on my hands. </p>

<p>As part of an assignment, I have been given a set of 3D points, as well as the time between them, and nothing else, and I'm supposed to find the tangential and normal velocities and accelerations between each point.</p>

<p>Now, I know that (tangential) velocity can be easily calculated simply by taking the differential of position over time, and that (tangential) acceleration can also be easily calculated by taking the differential of (tangential) velocity over time.</p>

<p>However, finding the normal velocities and accelerations is where I get stuck. I can find absolutely no information on how a normal velocity is calculated, except for the fact that any velocity vector can be broken down into its tangential and normal components.</p>

<p>However, since by calculating the (tangential) velocities by taking the differential of position over time, that means that the velocity vector IS the tangential velocity vector. Does that mean that the normal velocity for each and every point is just 0? That doesn't sound right to me.</p>

<p>Regarding normal acceleration, I have no idea how it's supposed to work in 3D, because we need the radius of a circle to be able to calculate that, but how do I calculate the radius of a sphere in 3D, given only two points?</p>

<p>Any help on this problem is greatly appreciated. This thing's driving me insane.</p>

"276824","How terms disappear in conservation of stress-energy tensor?","<p>If gravity is not present the stress-energy tensor has vanishing divergence so that using cartesian coordinates for spacetime we have
$$\partial_\mu T^{\mu \nu} = 0.$$</p>

<p>For above equation Carroll writes in his general relativity introduction book that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The equation with $\nu = 0$ corresponds to conservation of energy,
  while  $\partial_\mu T^{\mu k} = 0$ expresses conservation of kth
  component of momentum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I understand that for index $\mu = 0$ time derivative of energy and momentum density appear on the left side of the equation, but if I understand correctly partial derivative is defined as giving tensor with one more down index so that the left side is contraction of indices so that for fixed $\nu$ there should be four terms on left side. So for example for $\nu = 0$ the equation would give
$$\partial_0T^{00} + \partial_1T^{10} + \partial_2T^{20} + \partial_3T^{30} = 0.$$
How does Carroll's statement handle these extra three terms? Are they zero for some obvious reason I do not see or have I misunderstood the whole tensor notation?</p>

"276837","Will the universe end in a big crunch?","<p>Someone posted this to my question on QUORA.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Einstein's theory of relativity can be explained through the interactions of gravitational wave theory. Time dilation and length contraction can both be interpreted as results of the expansion and contraction of gravitational waves. When an object is moving at near light speed, it must be producing a huge amount of gravitational waves. An observer looking at the speeding object will see a distorted image caused by the expansion or contraction of gravitational waves.</p>
  
  <p>Time slows down or decreases because the distance is increased by the gravitational wave during the expansionary period. Length contraction is explained by the shortening of space-time during the contractionary period of the gravitational wave. The trough of the wave is located at the actual moving object itself while the crest is just in front of the object. However, once the gravitational wave finally hits the border of the universe, it will just permanently expand the space-time and therefore the universe. </p>
  
  <p>When the formation of gravitational waves start dissipating due to the lack of gravitational interactions, the universe will collapse on itself and restart the cycle of the Big Bang. However, gravitational waves will only stop being generated when all the matter in the universe combines into a super dense object/nucleus or SDN. Therefore, the maximum lifetime of a universe can be determined by how long until all the mass in it forms into one nucleus.</p>

"276839","Newtonian derivation of perturbation in density","<p>In Barbara Ryden's <em>Introduction to Cosmology</em>, chapter 12.3, she derives an equation describing the evolution of mass perturbations with time, for small perturbations $|\delta|\ll 1$. Before she starts the derivation, a disclaimer is added stating that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By performing Newtonian analysis of this problem, we are implicitly assuming that the radius $R$ is small compared to the Hubble distance and large compared to the Jeans length. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have added the derivation below, and was wondering where these implicit assumptions are taken into account.</p>

<p>Suppose a universe with pressure-less matter, with mean mass density $\overline{\rho}(t)$. As the universe expands, the density decreases as $\overline{\rho}(t)\propto a^{-3}(t)$, where $a$ is the scale factor of the universe. Consider a spherical region of radius $R$, to which a small amount of matter is added (or removed) so the density within the sphere is now $\rho(t) = \overline{\rho}(t)(1+\delta(t))$, where $|\delta| \ll1$. The total gravitational acceleration at the surface will be
$$
\ddot{R} = -\frac{GM}{R^2} = -\frac{4\pi}{3}G\overline{\rho}R - \frac{4\pi}{3}G\overline{\rho}\delta R
$$</p>

<p>By mass conservation, we know that
$$
\frac{4\pi \overline{\rho}(t)}{3}R^3(t)(1+\delta(t)) \equiv \textrm{const}
$$</p>

<p>From this, we get that
$$R(t)\propto a(t)(1+\delta)^{-\frac{1}{3}}\approx a(t) - \frac{1}{3}\delta a(t)$$</p>

<p>Taking double time derivative, we get 
$$
\ddot{R} \approx \ddot{a}(t) - \frac{1}{3}\ddot{\delta}a-\frac{1}{3}\delta\ddot{a} - \frac{2}{3}\dot{\delta}\dot{a}
$$
Dividing by $R$, we get
$$
\frac{\ddot{R}}{R} \approx \frac{\ddot{a}(t) - \frac{1}{3}\ddot{\delta}a-\frac{1}{3}\delta\ddot{a} - \frac{2}{3}\dot{\delta}\dot{a}}{a(1-\frac{1}{3}\delta)} \approx \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}\left(1+\frac{1}{3}\delta\right) - \frac{1}{3}\ddot{\delta}\left(1+\frac{\delta}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{3}\delta\frac{\ddot{a}}{a}\left(1+\frac{1}{3}\delta\right) - \frac{2}{3}\dot{\delta}\dot{a}\frac{1}{a}\left(1+\frac{1}{3}\delta\right)
$$
Taking only linear terms in $\delta$ (we neglect $\delta^2,\ddot{\delta}\delta$ as they are of second order in $\delta$), we get
$$
\frac{\ddot{R}}{R} \approx \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} - \frac{1}{3}\ddot{\delta}-\frac{2}{3}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\dot{\delta}
$$</p>

<p>Comparing with the gravitation equation, we get that the linear term, in charge of the small perturbation, yields
$$
\ddot{\delta} + 2H\dot\delta = 4\pi G\overline{\rho}\delta
$$
where $H$ is the Hubble parameter.</p>

<p>At which point are the above assumptions are implicitly applied?</p>

<p>The end A would get positively charged and the end B will get negatively charged. Now if I ground the sphere (in that same position ) , the negative charge or electrons will flow down to the ground. Now what would be a correct explanation for the flowing of electrons ? I am asking this because some people say that the negative charges should be held in place by the positive charges. 
2) Also what would happen if we connect the end A to the ground (Fig 3)?</p>

<p>3) If I have a battery and   I just connect the positive terminal to a wire (the circuit is incomplete). Will any charge develop on end (A) of the wire?  </p>

<p>I am asking this because I read here on Stack Exchange that the end A will get charged but the charge would be very less due to the very small capacitance of the wire. How can we calculate the charge developed on A if we know the capacitance of the wire and the voltage of the battery 
4) Finally  we have a capacitor in place of a battery and we connect the negative plate to a wire ( Fig 4).</p>

<p>Will any charge develop on the end A of the wire. I am asking this because I think that (this should also be in the case of the battery) that electrons shouldn't be able to flow from the negative plate to the end A of the wire because the electrons in the negative plate are held in place due to attraction by the positive charges on the other plate? </p>

<p>The idea is to utilise the energy of swatting a fly to capture air through an intake, compress it and ejecting it at a higher velocity in turn drawing more air through the intake creating a slight vacuum, enough to draw the fly into a holding container.</p>

<p>To reiterate I'm not looking to create a big suction from the intake itself. Think of the swatter more as a butterfly net. You are capturing the fly into the funnel and from within the funnel the air velocity would have increased enough to suck the fly the remainder of the way into the holding container.</p>

"276860","Expanding about the VEV to find the spectrum of the theory","<p>When attempting to find the spectrum of the theory after spontaneous symmetry breaking, of a gauge symmetry or otherwise, should we expand the potential in a Taylor series about the VEV or just substitute the shifted fields into the potential?</p>

<p>I am asking this question because I have seen both methods in various textbooks (eg Aitchison/Hey, Quigg).</p>

<p>For example, when attempting to showcase the existence of massless particles in the spectrum when we break a continuous symmetry, most books I have seen will give a potential, eg. $U(\phi) = \mu^2 |\phi|^2 + \lambda (|\phi|^2 )^2$, and expand in a Taylor series about the VEV. </p>

<p>Whereas in derivations for the Higgs mechanism with a Higgs potential $$\lambda \left[H^{\dagger} H - \frac{v^2}{2}\right] $$ In the unitary gauge, are left with a single real scalar field:</p>

<p>$$ H(x) \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \bar{h}(x) \end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<p>we shift the Higgs field by its VEV: $$ \bar{h}(x) = h(x) + v $$ and then substitute this directly into the potential. <strong>Why do we not simply undertake a Taylor expansion about the VEV for the Higgs field?</strong> Please excuse me if I am missing something obvious. </p>

<p>I feel I am mixing up concepts for Goldstone bosons emerging from spontaneous symmetry breaking of a global continuous symmetry and massive gauge bosons arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge theory. </p>

"276866","Entropy and internal energy","<p>Consider a system (an ideal gas) undergoing irreversible cycle, and let the cycle consist of two stages, expansion and contraction, then for the system, we have ΔU=0; Also for the surroundings ΔU=0.</p>

<p>case 1: during the expansion</p>

<p>dQ amount of heat goes into the system and dW is the work done on the surroundings by the system. Now, invoking the second law, we have dW &lt;= dQ.(since 100% conversion of heat is not allowed). </p>

"276867","Degree of Freedom of an $SU(n)$ Group","<p>I've been thinking about the DOF of the $SU(n)$ group. I first consider the DOF of a unitary matrix. See if I get this right:</p>

<p>Any unitary matrix can be written in the form of $e^{iH}$, where $H$ is a hermitian matrix. So the DOF of a unitary matrix is equal to that of a hermitian matrix. For any $n\times n$ matrix, there are $n^2$ matrix elements and each one has two DOF, so the total DOF is $2n^2$. The diagonal elements should all be real so that the DOF is reduced by $n$. Once the upper triangle is determined, the lower triangle is also determined. This reduce the DOF by $\frac{n^2-n}{2}\times2=n^2-n$. So the total DOF of a unitary matrix is:
$$2n^2-n-(n^2-n)=n^2$$</p>

<p>Now, consider a unitary matrix with unit determinant. I have problem understanding why this condition reduces one DOF.</p>

  <p>A hollow cone of height $h$ and diameter $d$ at the base is held with its axis vertical downwards and is filled with water. A small circular hole whose diameter is $1/n$ th that of the diameter of the base is made at the vertex.

  $(4 \sqrt2 - 1) n^2 \sqrt h / 12.4 \sqrt g$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you arrive at this formula?</p>

<p>So far I know that:</p>

<p>$dt = A dh / Q $and then you integrate to find time.
You have to express area in terms of water height above circular hole.<br>
This a truncated cone and the area between two horizontal lines of the cone is constant and equal to $\pi/4 (d/n)^2$. We have to determine angle $\theta$. </p>

<p>Length of each opposite side (o) of triangle for the side slopes of cone is
$o = (d - d/n) / 2 $
Using $h$ and $o$, $tan \theta $ can be calculated: $\tan 0 = o/h$ where h is maximum height of water.</p>

<p>diameter $d$ at any height:$ d(h) = 2 \tan (0)(h) + (d/n)$
Muliplying by $\pi /4 $ gives area at any height.</p>

<p>But the challenge that I'm having here is that when you take $2tan (0)(h) + (d/n)$ and put $tan 0 = ((d - d/n) / 2) / h$ into $d(h)$, $h$ cancels out.<br>
h relating to $tan  \theta $ is the maximum height so $h = h$ for that and doesn't change, but $h$ in the $d(h)$ formula varies, so how do I handle this. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My approaches to form the kinematics constraint equations:-</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Approach 1:-</strong>
The length $\ell$ of the string connecting the two blocks $A$ and $B$ can be written as follows
$$\sqrt{{x_A}^2+h^2}+x_B+R\theta=\ell$$
On differentiating the above equation we get
$$\dfrac{x_A}{\sqrt{{x_A}^2+h^2}}\cdot\dfrac{dx_A}{dt}+\dfrac{dx_B}{dt}=0\implies \dfrac{x_A}{\sqrt{{x_A}^2+h^2}}\cdot\dfrac{dx_A}{dt}=-\dfrac{dx_B}{dt}$$
As the block $A$ moves rightward $x_A$ increases while $x_B$ decreases. So, $\dfrac{dx_A}{dt}=v_A$ and $\dfrac{dx_B}{dt}=-v_B$. So, the kinematic constraint equation for velocity is as follows
$$\dfrac{x_A}{\sqrt{{x_A}^2+h^2}}\cdot v_A=v_B\implies v_A\cos\alpha=v_B\ \qquad\qquad\left(\because \cos\alpha=\dfrac{x_A}{\sqrt{{x_A}^2+h^2}}\right)$$</p>

<p><strong>Approach 2:-</strong></p>

<p>The velocity of block $B$, $v_B$ is along the string hence there could be two possible constraints according to me as follows:-
$$v_B\sec\alpha=v_A$$
or
$$v_B\cos\alpha=v_A$$
Please do tell me as why $v_B\sec\alpha=v_A$ is correct and the other one is wrong.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:-</strong> sammy gerbil's solution did clear it nicely, but I was being bugged about the thing in a different way. I had considered that what would have happened if the velocities in both the cases (the cases being the projection of the velocity along the rope in the direction of the movement of block $A$, and the other one being the projection of the velocity of the block $A$ along the direction of the rope) if resolved into components would affect the movement of the one, in the direction of which the velocities have been resolved. </p>

<p><strong>Case 1:-</strong> </p>

<p>So, what I had considered in the case of the velocity along the rope being projected in the direction of the notion of the block $A$ is as follows:-</p>

<p>If the velocity of the rope is resolved as stated above then, in the direction of the motion of the block $A$ the projected velocity will be $v_B\cos\alpha$ 
and in the perpendicular direction it will be $v_B\sin\alpha$, as the block is not allowed to move in that direction, so the ground does something(yeah, the ground does something, I am not at all sure if the ground does somethuing in this case, so some clarification on this too) which doesn't let it move in the perpendicular direction. So, according to me this is a probable case too.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2:-</strong></p>

<p>In this case what I had considered was that if we resolve the velocity of the block $A$ along the rope and perpendicular to the rope we get that the velocity component along the rope comes out to be $v_A\cos\alpha$ and perpendicular to it comes out to be $v_A\sin\alpha$. Now, the perpendicular component changes the direction of the rope and the component along the rope produces the needed velocity along the rope to make the block $B$ move upwards. So, this case is also possible.</p>

<p>So, what is wrong in the 1st case that it is not the answer, but the case-2 is.</p>

"276905","Topology of Zero","<p>The Reproduction of Life as the Evolution of Technology:
To the brain, the brain is the most complex known object in it's self-proclaimed ""Observable Universe"". The brain's function is to translate a simulated(hallucinated?) abstractuality, formulated from the nervous system receiving and transporting stimuli, through approximating algorithmic processes to render a relative reality. Technology, as a development from the network(s) of human brains, has evolved to the point where one can see the limit, of this exponentially unfurling technology, as a perfectly simulated reproduction of relative reality. These evolutionary ""forces"" have been compartmentalized, however, in realization of their symbiotic limitation, that is a relative reality, one can see an unified ""aspiration"" of mastering the mind/The mind being the master. Therefore, I deem anthropomorphic ""metaphors"" onto the ""mechanistic"" to be literally analogous and not only permissible but assertively appropriate; vice-versa.
Event Horizon(s) of Civilization(s) Advancing Technology:
The Kardashev scale, proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication. It began outwards and measured advancement by macrodimensional scales. There are designated amounts of energy that differentiate these expanding types but are symbolically represented as such:
Type I is planetary size energy control
Type II is solar size energy control
Type III is galactic size energy control
Type IV is universal size control
Type V is multiversal size control
Dr. Michio Kaku, American theoretical physicist, in 2004, suggests in his book ""Parallel Worlds"" Type IV being dark energy control.
John D. Barrow, realizing that humans have found it more cost-effective to extend their abilities to manipulate their environment over increasingly smaller dimensions, rather than increasingly larger ones, reversed the classification downward from Type Ⅰ-minus to Type Omega-minus. This is to go inward and toward, measuring a civilization's technological advancement by microdimensional mastery, as such:
Type Ⅰ-minus is capable of manipulating objects over the scale of themselves: building structures, mining, joining and breaking solids.
Type Ⅱ-minus is capable of manipulating genes and altering the development of living things, transplanting or replacing parts of themselves, reading and engineering their genetic code.
Type Ⅲ-minus is capable of manipulating molecules and molecular bonds, creating new materials.
Type Ⅳ-minus is capable of manipulating individual atoms, creating nanotechnologies on the atomic scale and creating complex forms of artificial life.
Type Ⅴ-minus is capable of manipulating the atomic nucleus and engineering the nucleons that compose it.
Type Ⅵ-minus is capable of manipulating the most elementary particles of matter (quarks and leptons) to create organized complexity among populations of elementary particles; culminating in.
Type Omega-minus is capable of manipulating the basic structure of space and time.
Note: The arbitrary nature of defining “scale” to ever-increasing “levels” of omnipotence. 
Elaboration/Explanation:
Now philosophically, to straighten this out, to explain my introduction, I must turn it inside-out. A ""Bootstrap Paradox"" is the paradox of time travel in which objects or pieces of information are never literally created, because their existence begins by arriving from the future and ends by going to the past to become themselves. This paradoxical idea is attributed as a deus ex machina and well-known in movies like Back to the Future and Terminator, and TV series like Doctor Who. These portrayals are seen as flukes and gimmicks to explain the story but provide no explanation in why the glitch in the matrix benefits them. Furthermore, the anomaly of this paradox, to my knowledge, has only been imagined, science fictionally, in temporal terms and applied to time; albeit our space-time continuum being concretely-inseparable(nonabstractually).
Now, in application of the supposition that there is a fundamental space-time continuum ""Bootstrap paradox"" principle we may extrapolate: That which is ""Micro"" is the ""Future"" and that which is ""Macro"" is the ""Past"", however, they exist <em>Now/Here</em>(Fluid-Superposition?) and not how we normally(usually?) think of them; perspectively ""Forwards"" and ""Backwards"" VS ""In"" and ""Out"". The ""M"" in M-Theory can represent ""Membrane""(or Magic or Mystery) and is most commonly known as ""String Theory"". This theory imagines Hyperspace(11 dimensions is argued over 16 for there is instability, mathematically, in higher dimensions), consisting of a multitude of parallel universes as membranes, in total being an amalgamation of vibrating two-dimensional ""strings"" or in a variant version ""loops"". (Could/Should elaborate but suffice for initial idea.)
Now, in recognition of our brain's as membranes and that ""touch"" is opposing force(s) and not ""contact"", we can draw the parallel that our brains are parallel-membrane-”micro”-(multi/uni)verses. The neural-connectivity of neurons and synapses in our brain(s) is relativisticly so complex, it's analogous to a civilization's technology colonizing the universe. This is how the ""Micro"" is the ""Future"" because the extrapolated future of a “universal”-technologically-conveyed-connectivity, translated proportional to the scale of complexity in our brains, is fractalically/holographically self-similar. In other words, the ""end goal"" of civilization, to colonize the Universe through technological connectivity, is stylistically self-similar to our ""starting place"" the brain, itself.
Now... Where to begin?
Now, to begin: There was no beginning; No past. 
If there was a beginning, it would have started from nothing... But that would mean that there was no ""beginning"", no ""it""; no ""thing"" to start from. One may then ask, ""Well... How then did I get 'Here'?"" Well, the answer to that questing question is one of infinite detail and unfathomable distance... However, that kind of journey reminds me of a lost tourist trying to get to (Abstraction Irrelevant) and in asking a local for directions, the local replied, ""Well, I do know how to get there, but if I were you, I wouldn't start from 'Here'.""
Now, to entertain the ""beginning"" as starting from ""nothing"" or ""no thing(s)""; no mass and no matter. This would be to begin in the absolute emptiness of void. In trying to imagine nothing most people take a shape out of Plato's ""Platonic Realm"" a circle or sphere to envision/encompass(attempt to [circum]navigate) the void as if ""it"" were the emptiness of a vessel; the vessel is reflective of their method. Plato's student Euclid, ""The Father of Geometry"" would propose a center to Plato's circle(sphere), an axel, an axiom of his ""Euclidean Point""; infinitesimal small with no dimensional attributes/location but no magnitude. As the ""Father of Geometry""(Geo=Earth Metry=Measure) with the approximation of measure, Euclid drew the line(s) for mathematical imaging(mental imagining). This is to metaphysically morph the proverbial circle of life into a triangular food-chain of power and the expanding sphere of knowledge into a scaffolding of coordinated grid paper; corner that which was rounded off.
Now, this behavior is a wild goose chase because it's trying to (find the) shape that which is shapeless. Shape is boundary, definition, and form; enclosure(trap). Void has nothing to form, nothing to define, and nothing to bound(bind/get over).
Befuddling, I know, but a quote of mine to keep us going:
""Discouragement might be a hint to turn around but many people take 'it' as a challenge and as a dare to perpetuate.""
Now, feeling enthusiastically discouraged, let's take a step in another direction. To make an anti-euclidean point: Imagine a negative euclidean point or negative platonic circle. This may seem difficult but think of a torus(donut, inner-tube, etc.) and remove the inner most line of circumference. In doing so the ""shape"" is no longer a shape because the ""inside"" and ""outside"" are the same, like a Mobius Strip, a surface with one continuous side formed by joining the ends of a rectangular strip after twisting one end through 180°, or an unpractical(most practical?) Klein Bottle, a closed surface with only one side, formed by passing one end of a tube through the side of the tube and joining it to the other end.Now, this negative euclidean point or negative platonic circle is the pivoting point of curved space-time and the source of event horizons ""within"" and ""without"" the figure of an almost-torus. This image(imagining) in void would produce the illusion of ""force"" from the ""inside"" to the ""outside""; more nothingness ""pulls"" less nothingness(tonicity: the state of a solution in respect of osmotic pressure. More pure water ""attracts"" water from the less pure water through the membrane boundary.).
Now, this is to turn the head of traditional theoretical physicists who persist in the theory that ""matter""(something unfounded) creates a ""gravitational-force"" between masses. ""Matter"" is something imagined that has yet to be found but nothing is nothing and cannot be found. Thusly, ""Gravity"" then may be metaphorically comprehended as a meteorologist comprehends weather but in terms of negative barometric pressure. This is to assume ""black/white holes""/""Singularities"" on all scales, which ""gravity"" or for lack of better words, ""vacuum pull/push"" is a dynamic of nothingness; Determined, interdependently, by the relativity of size and distance proportionately to produce ""structure"" patterns. This, to me, allows unification of the ""Strong Force"" and ""Weak Force"" for the ""particle"" and ""object"" are influenced most by the nearest, in terms of scale, ""black/white hole"".
In Conclusion Poetic Guesstimating:
The relative reality of reality is a fractal simulation of dividing by zero. Nothing is the sum total of all possibilities and thus something is nothing but that is everything. 
From zero, from the nothingness of void, there is the subtracted imaginary numbers, imaginary possibilities. Imaginary numbers by differing from the positive and negative create an asymmetrical system. Thusly, this that is, is the opposing and balancing actuality of an imaginary abstractuality in the reality of nothingness. </p>

<p>The uncertainty principle states that</p>

  <p>A tennis ball has a mass of 0.057 kg. A professional tennis player hits the ball hard enough to give it a speed of 46 m/s (about 103 miles per hour.) The ball moves toward the left, hits a wall and bounces straight back to the right with almost the same speed (46 m/s).

<p>After solving a very similar problem correctly, I took the following approach to solve it.</p>

This is the average velocity from the time that the ball first makes contact with the wall until it comes to rest, and this answer was marked as correct. </p>

<p>$$t=\frac{|\vec{r}|}{|\vec{v_{avg}}|}=\frac{0.027 m}{23 \frac{m}{s}}=.0012\, s$$

"276927","Thermodynamics of an Arctic greenhouse?","<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>For a business project, I'm looking into the viability of a greenhouse situated in Canada's far northern town of Iqaluit. The problem is how to mathematically simulate the internal air temperature of the greenhouse. </p>

<p><strong>WHAT I ALREADY HAVE</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>detailed 3D renderings of the greenhouse</li>
<li>all materials with their corresponding thermodynamic values such as K-valuesI </li>
<li>climate data that shows the approximate intensity of solar radiation in Iqaluit, angles of sunlight throughout the day and hourly temperature data. </li>
<li>data for the required environment for certain crops to thrive, such as humidity, required sunlight, temperature fluctuations, pH, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>What make this greenhouse investigation unique is that the greenhouse is a much smaller affordable design that is meant to grow a small supplementary source of fresh produce for low-income families which often suffer from food insecurity in northern towns such as Iqaluit due to prohibitively high costs for fresh produce. </p>

<p>We would also like to strive for simplistic, mechanical systems that are easier to maintain and less prone to failure. A major concern of the group as of now is by how much could the internal air temperature plummet by at night? </p>

<p><strong>GOAL</strong></p>

<p>The goal in mind is to use the information we have so far to determine: </p>

<p>1) <strong>Is it possible to grow vegetables such as leafy greens within the current design WITHOUT an external power source other than purely sunlight?</strong> (A greenhouse that does not require electric heating is a major goal) How does the internal air temperature vary with the current design? </p>

<p>2) In the case that the current design is not sufficient for healthy crop growth, what modifications are necessary? (Many potential solutions have been considered) </p>

<ul>
<li>Have a <strong>solar powered heater</strong> that charges through the day and
intermittently provides heat through the night.</li>
<li>Greatly increase <strong>thermal insulation</strong> surrounding the greenhouse through the use of a thick air-inflated wrap that surrounds the entire structure in addition to thicker polycarbonate panels for construction. </li>
<li>Use a setup of concave <strong>reflective panels</strong> surrounding the greenhouse to increase the amount of heat collected during the day. I have already done some calculations but my numbers ended up far off. Equations I have worked with so far are Q = mcΔT, Q/t = (A) (ΔT) / (Thermal Heat Transfer Coefficient). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I think the problem demands looking at every single material and also examining the characteristics of the air inside as an ideal gas, as well as the poly-carbonate and it's emissivity/albedo (black body) characteristics. </p>

<p>Any steps or hints in the right direction with equations or methods of calculation would be greatly appreciated!</p>

"276928","Influences on wavefunction path analysis","<p>I was looking at simulations of a wave going through a slit. When the wavelength was much smaller than the slit width, the wave went through the slit and kept going straight like a laser beam. But when the wavelength was larger than the slit width, the wave spread in all directions when going through the slit. My question is, if a single moving neutron is ejected toward a single slit, and the neutron’s De Broglie wavelength is long compared to the slit width, then can the neutron go through the slit and take a <em>direct</em> right turn?</p>

<p>I ask this because the neutron has mass inertia, and therefore it seems odd for the neutron to take a trajectory path of going forward and then immediately turn right. Imagine you traveling a vehicle at some velocity, and then instantly turning right. The g-forces would be incredible. A wave, on the other hand, can wrap around corners. So I was thinking that the neutrons mass inertia plays a role in how sharp of an angle it can turn. I know mass inertia plays a role in the De Broglie wavelength in terms of momentum, but I'm not referring to that. I know the De Broglie wavelength changes relative to the neutron's velocity. I'm referring to the neutron’s ability or inability to take any path that a wave at the De Broglie wavelength can follow. Also I understand that the De Broglie wave is not considered to be a wave like sound such that it's made of atoms, gas, or known particles. I'm referring to a wavefunction analysis.</p>

<p>Another example of why I'm asking this question is the role gravity can play. For example if the slit experiment is turned sideways such that the neutron is traveling parallel to the planet. Gravity would change the trajectory path. Nothing changed in the experiment except for the addition of gravity. So it seemed to me that path probability analysis can require more than just wave analysis. I’d imagine static magnetic fields from a permanent magnet or electrically charged plates could play a role as well.</p>

<p>In short, I was wondering if the particle’s own inertia, gravity and other fields could significantly affect the probability path analysis. Maybe the proper way is to first do a wavefunction analysis, and then apply inertia forces, gravity, etc. Although I'm most interested in the first example of how inertia plays a role in the trajectory probability path, perhaps even preventing the particle from making too sharp of turns. If it makes any difference, I'm interested in how Many Worlds Interpretations handles this. Thanks!</p>

<p>$$
\langle \phi|\chi \rangle = \langle \chi|\phi \rangle ^*
$$</p>

<p>Or equivalently why </p>

<p>$$
|\chi \rangle ^* = \langle \chi |
$$</p>

<p>I tried to understand it with the following argument (which follows Feynman Lecture's Vol 3 Ch 5). If you have the Feynman lectures, I'm trying to understand how Feynman gets equation 5.26.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lets say $R$ is a particular complete three-dimensional basis for the states our system can take (like for a spin-1 particle), with basis vectors $R_1,R_2,R_3$.</p>

<p>A state $\chi$ can be represented in this basis since the basis is complete:
$$
|\chi\rangle=\sum_{i=1,2,3}|R_i\rangle\langle R_i | \chi \rangle
$$</p>

<p>Now consider the quantity $$\langle \chi | \chi \rangle$$ Physically, we would say <em>this is the complex amplitude for a system in state $\chi$ to be in state $\chi$</em>. It is just a number (which could be complex if we haven't assumed $|\chi \rangle ^* = \langle \chi |$).</p>

<p>Since the probability associated with this amplitude is the norm (length) of the amplitude, we can say confidently that whatever number $\langle \chi | \chi \rangle$ is, its norm is one:
$$
\langle \chi | \chi \rangle^*\langle \chi | \chi \rangle=1
$$
In words, there is 100% probability the system is in the state it is in. </p>

<p>But it seems to me that only restricts it to the unit circle in the complex plane: $\langle \chi | \chi \rangle = e^{i\theta}$ where $\theta$ could be anything.</p>

<p>If we write $\langle \chi | \chi \rangle$  in our $R$ basis, we get
$$
\langle \chi | \chi\rangle=\sum_{i=1,2,3}\langle \chi |R_i\rangle\langle R_i | \chi \rangle = e^{i\theta}
$$
We see that each term $\langle \chi |R_i\rangle\langle R_i | \chi \rangle$ can only vary (for different choices of $R$) in ways that preserve the last equality, but it seems like requiring</p>

<p>$$
\langle R_i|\chi \rangle = \langle \chi|R_i \rangle ^*
$$</p>

<p>Is too strong a condition if $\theta$ is arbitrary. If $\theta=0$ or you needed to pick a value and stick with it, I could see why that condition <em>may</em> be required, but I'm not even sure about that. Or maybe I just don't see the argument.</p>

<p>Can anyone help with the reasoning here?</p>

<p>In Feynman lectures, he says effectively that because the probability for $\chi$ to be <em>any</em> state in $R$ is 1 (R is a complete basis)</p>

<p>$$
\langle R_1 | \chi \rangle \langle R_1 | \chi \rangle ^ * + 
\langle R_2 | \chi \rangle \langle R_2 | \chi \rangle ^ * + 
\langle R_3 | \chi \rangle \langle R_3 | \chi \rangle ^ * = 1
$$
and because the amplitude $\langle \chi | \chi \rangle = 1$...
$$
\langle \chi | R_1 \rangle \langle R_1 | \chi \rangle + 
\langle \chi | R_2 \rangle \langle R_2 | \chi \rangle + 
\langle \chi | R_3 \rangle \langle R_3 | \chi \rangle = 1
$$</p>

<p>Then because $R$ and $\chi$ can freely vary, I guess (?) each term could maybe vary independently requiring for each term that
$$
\langle \chi | R_i \rangle = \langle R_i | \chi \rangle ^*
$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this were not true, probability wouldn't be ""conserved,"" and
  particles would get ""lost."" -Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but this does assume the <em>amplitude</em> in the second equation is $1$ (not $e^{i \theta} $ ) while it safely assumes the <em>probability</em> in the first is $1$.</p>

<p>Care to help me understand this argument?</p>

<p>Someone could instead prove that any choice <em>other</em> than $1$ would result in absurd physics. Or someone could explain that $\langle \phi|\chi \rangle = \langle \chi|\phi \rangle ^*$ results from a deeper symmetry.</p>

"276940","A Particle in a half harmonic oscillator/half infinite square well potential","<p>The question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a particle in a 2D hybrid infinite square well/ >harmonic oscillator potential. That is, the potential is given by $V(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} kx^2$ for $0 &lt; y &lt; a$, and is infinite outside. In other words the potential the particle experiences is a harmonic oscillator potential in the x-direction, and in the y-direction and infinite square well.</p>
  
  <p>a.) write down the 2D time-independent Schrödinger equation for this particle inside the well</p>
  
  <p>b.) Use Separation of variables to derive two separate ordinary differential equations for X and Y in terms of $k_x$ and $k_y$ where $E=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(k_x^2 + k_y^2 \right)$.</p>
  
  <p>c.) For the y-direction apply the boundary conditions to find the possible values of $k_y$</p>
  
  <p>d.) What are the possible energy levels E for this particle? Hint: you know that $E_n =\hbar \omega \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)$ for the harmonic oscillator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For part a.), I wrote the following for the Schrödinger Equation:
$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right) \psi + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \psi=E\psi$$
I'm fairly certain I have this right. Since inside the potential the only contribution is from the harmonic oscillator potential. </p>

<p>For part b.), I wrote $\psi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$ to get a separable solution:
$$\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right) X(x)Y(y) + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 X(x)Y(y)&amp;=EX(x)Y(y)\\
\implies -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} \right) + \frac{1}{2} kx^2 &amp;=E 
\end{align}$$
Here is where I get unsteady. I know that since the energy is constant the two terms must add to constants, so that

"276942","Pythagoras Cup Question","<p>My TA professor has asked me to write a homework question about the Pythagoras cup. After posting this previously I realized I should have given some more background information and not leave the question so open-ended.</p>

<p>The Pythagoras Cup is a vessel with a hollow column in the center that is connected to a pipe that empties out of the bottom of the cup's stand. Its design is credited to Pythagoras but I found just as many sources saying someone else designed it as he did. Anyway here are some links that give more background information. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-YMHXuiaWw"" rel=""nofollow"">Pythagoras Cup YouTube</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_cup"" rel=""nofollow"">Pythagoras Cup Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the question I would like to ask the students, please let me know what I can improve or if you think it's fine.</p>

<p>An archeologist is on a dig in Greece when they come across a pottery vessel (I copied a picture of the cross section from Wikipedia). Upon further examination of the vessel, the archaeologist sees that the inner column is hollow, with small holes on both sides and pipe going through the center of the column and emptying out the stand. The archaeologist notices that upon filling the vessel with water to the top that it drains the entirety of its contents. The archaeologist repeats this but only fills the vessel half way and observes that the water stays completely inside the vessel.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>
Explain why the vessel doesn’t empty itself when it is only filled half way but does when it filled to the top. What would happen if the archeologist filled the vessel with a small amount of a denser liquid before pouring the water in?<strong>Hint:</strong> Consider the forces acting on the fluid when the water is filled to the top and when it is only filled half way separately. </p>

<p><strong>Solution to Q1:</strong>
When the water is filled half way the hydrostatic forces from pressure and gravity are constant. See also Pascal’s Law of Communicating vessels. When the water is filled over the height of the central column the water inside the column has nowhere else to go but into the pipe. When the water enters the pipe gravity begins pulling it down which creates a siphon because of the difference in pressure. (I don't expect them to recognize that this is a siphon, but as long as they notice that the water in the inner column must be the same height as the water in the cup until the water goes over the top of the column then the weight of the water now in the central pipe creates a pressure difference ""pulling"" the water out I would give them full credit.) The weight of the water would not be enough to force the denser fluid into the central column.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
Calculate the mass flow rate of water leaving the vessel as a function of the time after it has been filled to the top. Assume that the vessel can be modeled as shown to the right (I've included a drawing I made in CAD of the cup) and that the vessel is cylindrical and the dimensions of the column are much smaller than the dimensions of the vessel. $D=4.5$ inches, $d_1=\frac{3}{4}$ inches, $d_2=\frac{1}{8}$ inches,  $H=6$ inches, $h_1=3$ inches, $h_2=6$ inches, $h_3=2$ inches and $g=32.2 ft/s^2$. <strong>Hint:</strong> You may assume that the velocity of the water leaving the vessel is $V=\sqrt{2gy(t)}$ where $y(t)$ is the height of the water in the vessel measured from the bottom of the stand. The students have not been taught Bernoulli's equation yet so I gave them the velocity leaving the pipe. I also gave them more information then they need to solve the problem, the way I came up with an answer only needed $\rho$, $g$, $H$, $D$, and $d_2$.</p>

<p><strong>Solution to Q2:</strong>
Use the conservation of mass equation.
$$ \dot m_{in}-\dot m_{out}=\frac{d m_{CV}}{dt}$$</p>

<p>There is no mass entering the vessel so $\dot m_{in}=0$.</p>

<p>The amount of mass leaving the vessel is $\dot m_{out}=\rho V_{out}A_{out}=\rho\sqrt{2gy(t)}\frac{\pi}{4}d_2^2$.</p>

<p>The amount of mass in the vessel (ignoring the mass inside the column) is $m_{CV}=\rho\frac{\pi}{4}D^2y(t)$.</p>

<p>Plugging these into the conservation of mass equation gives
$$-\rho\sqrt{2gy(t)}\frac{\pi}{4}d_2^2=\rho\frac{\pi}{4}D^2\frac{dy}{dt}$$
$$-\sqrt{2gy(t)}\frac{d_2^2}{D^2}=\frac{dy}{dt}$$
separating the ODE
$$-\sqrt{2g}\frac{d_2^2}{D^2}dt=Kdt=\frac{dy}{\sqrt{y(t)}}$$
and integrating
$$Kt+c_1=2\sqrt{y(t)}$$
the cup is filled to the top at the beginning so $y(t)$ measured from the bottom of the stand (the datum) at $t=0$ is $y(0)=H$.
$$c_1=2\sqrt{H}$$
$$Kt=2\begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{y(t)}-\sqrt{H}\end{pmatrix}$$
the original question asked for the mass flow rate leaving the cup so plugging this answer into the $\dot m_{out}$ equation gives
$$\dot m_{out}=-\rho\sqrt{2gy(t)}\frac{\pi}{4}d_2^2$$
$$\dot m_{out}=\rho\begin{pmatrix}\frac{g}{2}\frac{d_2^2}{D^2}-\sqrt{2gH}t\end{pmatrix}\frac{\pi}{4}d_2^2$$
the students can plug in the numbers from the problem but I'm mainly going to be looking for the above equation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harry Potter is chasing his nemesis Draco Malfoy during a quidditch match. Initially, Harry is $35\;\mathrm{m}$ behind Draco, who has just spotted the Golden Snitch hovering $75\;\mathrm{m}$ away at the edge of the playing field. Draco flies at a constant speed of $40\;\mathrm{m/s}$ straight towards the Golden Snitch. If Harry’s is originally flying at $50\;\mathrm{m/s}$, what acceleration does he need to reach the Snitch $75\;\mathrm{cm}$ ($0.75\;\mathrm{m}$) ahead of Draco?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end position would need to be Harry's $\Delta x = 110\;\mathrm{m}$, and Draco's $\Delta x = 74.25 \;\mathrm{m}$. It would take Draco $1.85625\;\mathrm{s}$ to reach $\Delta x = 74.25\;\mathrm{m}$, so Harry would need to decrease his time to at least $1.85625\;\mathrm{s}$ as well, while still going the $\Delta x = 110\;\mathrm{m}$ (currently takes him $2.2\;\mathrm{s}$ at $50\;\mathrm{m/s}$). When taking Harry's velocity ($50 \;\mathrm{m/s}$) over the minimum time needed ($1.85625\;\mathrm{s}$) I got $26.936 \;\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (rounded). Is there something I am doing wrong? This seems incorrect.</p>

<p>Edit: I tried a different solution, that seems to be better. Using the same minimum time that would need to be met (1.85625 sec.), traveling 110 m, I found the final velocity needing to be 59.25925926 (Δx=110/∆t=1.85625) m/s. Using the difference between that, and the initial velocity (50 m/s), divided by 1.85625 sec. I got acceleration being $4.99 \;\mathrm{m/s^2}$ when rounded.</p>

"276990","Is quantum physics all about wave-particle duality?","<p>AFAIK, the (summarized) story is as follows:</p>

<p>For a long time, the matter is thought of as having a single form: The particle form. Then, observations on light has led to the thought that light is a weird matter, which has a wave form (as opposed to all the rest of the matter, all of which have particle forms). Later, photoelectric effect is observed and this led to the thought that this effect cannot be explained by thinking the light in the wave form. Hence, this led to the thought that the light is actually an even weirder matter than it was previously thought of, and it has a dual form of wave-particle form. Even later, De Broglie stated that this weirdness is not specific to the light, but it applies to <em>all</em> matter (I. E, <em>all</em> matter demonstrates both wave form, and particle form). And the Quantum Physics born.</p>

<p>So is the punchline the following:</p>

<p>Matter is weirder than we have thought. We have thought that we could explain the matter with a simple model of particle form, but various experiments have shown us that this model is not sufficient to explain all phenomena (especially the phenomena involving small matters). So we create a new model, in which the matter neither has only particle form, nor has only wave form, but it has a dual form of wave-particle form. And to explain the interaction of matter under forces in this new (weird) model, we create the Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<p>The question is that is the atmospheric pressure due to the weight of air or collisions of the molecules. If according to bright magnus' answer it is due to both weight and collisions then if at sea level we close the cap of a bottle ,then the pressure in the bottle will the pressure outside because the weight of the air above is transmitted through the cap. But If we take this same bottle at Everest or say space the weight of the air above would be significantly less at Everest and in the case of space there will be no air outside the bottle to transmit the pressure. But still the pressure in the will be the same as it was at sea level. Why is it so. How has small column of air in the bottle got the same pressure as the entire atmosphere ( the bottle off course is of tough material and doesn't blast).
Also if the total pressure is due to both the weight of the air and the collision s of the molecules then why do we not include a pressure term due to collision of molecules in the equation for total pressure which is P =hpg and which includes the part of pressure only dusri weight. I am gettingconfused here. Can The same argument be extended to water.... </p>

"277073","What happens to the angular momentum of two merging black holes?","<p>Let's suppose that two black holes of roughly equal mass in a binary system forming from say a large mass stellar binary system are in orbits around their center of mass. Further suppose that we are looking at their equations of motion well in advance of their merger. 
As a very crude approximation, I am using the Schwartzchild metric even though I know that this not a spherically symmetric system.
The effective potential in this metric would be of the form:</p>

<p>$$V_{eff}=\frac{\mu c^2}{2}[-\frac{r_s}{r}+\frac{a^2}{r^2}-\frac{r_s a^2}{r^3}]$$</p>

<p>Where $a=\frac{L}{mc}$, $r_s$ is the Schwartzchild radius, and $\mu$ is the reduced mass.</p>

<p>So as this system loses energy via gravitational waves, they would eventually reach a circular orbit with a radius $$r_{min}=\frac{a^2}{r_s}(1+\sqrt{1-\frac{3r_s^2}{a^2}})$$ which is a local minimum in this effective potential. </p>

<p>However, to lose more energy and merge, there is a centripetal barrier to overcome. The only way I see around this is for the system to lose orbital angular momentum to a point where $a=\sqrt{3}r_s$ when this barrier disappears.</p>

<p>I know this fairly crude and in reality this requires computer simulations using Einstein's field equations, but it seems to me that for black holes to merge they would need to lose orbital angular momentum as well as energy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does the system transfer orbital angular momentum to the spin angular momentum of the black holes basically spinning them up as they approach one another?

"277091","Thermal expansion of a rotating disc","<p>This question came up in a discussion section today. Some fellow students and I broke our heads on it for a while but couldn't come to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a thin disc of mass $M$, radius $R$ and uniform density that's rotating about its symmetry axis with a constant angular velocity $\omega$. Ignore friction. You immerse the disc into a heat bath that's $\Delta T$ degrees warmer than the disc, which causes the size of the disc to expand with some coefficient $\alpha &gt; 0$:</p>

<p>$\Delta R = \alpha\,\Delta T\,R$ and hence to first order in $\alpha \Delta T$</p>

<p>$\Delta R^2 \approx 2\alpha\, \Delta T\,R^2$</p>

<p>This clearly increases the moment of inertia $I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$ of the disc.</p>

<p>The question is, what now happens to the angular momentum $L$ and the energy $E$ of the disc? If you assume $L$ is conserved since (as far as I can see) there is no external torque working on the system, then $\omega$ will decrease by the same factor $I$ increases by; but this decreases the overall rotational energy $E = I\omega^2/2$. This seems counterintuitive - energy somehow needs to escape the disc, but it cannot flow into the heat bath since the latter is at equal or higher temperature than the disc. If you assume that $L$ is not conserved, then does it increase or decrease and where does the corresponding torque come from or go to? </p>

  <p><em>""$\left|u_1\right&gt;$ is an eigenvector common to H and B. We therefore have, obviously $HB\left|u_1\right&gt;=BH\left|u_1\right&gt;.$ We see, then, that for $H$ and  $B$ to commute, it is suficient that the restrictions of these operators to the subspace $\mathscr{E}_2$, spanned by $\left|u_2\right&gt;$ and $\left|u_3\right&gt;$, commute. Now, in this subspace, the matrix representing H is equal to $-h\omega I$ (where $I$ is the $2\times2$ unit matrix), which commutes with all $2\times 2$ matrices. $H$ and $B$ therefore commute.""</em></p>

<p>Chamber A is filled with cold water, and B with ground coffee. As you heat the water, steam builds up, increasing the pressure in A. This then forces water up through B, where it is soaked up by the coffee. Once the coffee has expanded, it provides more resistance, and as such the pressure in A increases further. At this point, the water is then forced through B, and up the pipe into C where it then bubbles out to fill the chamber. This makes total sense to me. </p>

<p>However, a problem occurs when you fill A above the safety valve shown in the second picture. The water in chamber A boils much earlier, and is then forced out through the valve, and also from B where the pot screws together. Very little water actually flows up into chamber C.</p>

<p>In my understanding, if you have two chambers connected by a pipe and you increase the pressure of the lower one, then surely water should flow into the upper chamber at a faster rate. It seems like this effect has an <em>optimum pressure</em>, above which an increase in pressure is actually detrimental to the effect. Why should this be the case, and is there a name or term for this process?</p>

I read some articles that justify all electrons properties just by it spinnin at c: they mention auto induction, magnetic pressure (?) that compensates charge repulsion, resonant frequency of LC circuit etc...</p>

<p><sup>[Note: do you know why the actual spinning of the electron has been discarded and a meaningless 'intrinsic' property has been accepted? I know little of the mentioned processes an formulas, but one thing strikes me as plain and obvious, if the charge spins at near c the magnetic attraction almos compensate the repulsion, and the residual force explains the perfect spherical shape.
Also, using the classical values, the magnitude of the spin is short by a factor smaller than 10 and  a spin at 0.995 c already produces an angular momentum 10 times greater.]</sup></p>

<p>Can you please focus on (auto-) induction if it exists, or on what could cause a boost of the original energy?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>since it has been considered a duplicate: isn't there a great difference between speed at near c or at c, in the consequences a charge would experience when it can be affected byits own electrostatic force?</p>

We can obtain the moment of inertia, I, of this body, it is equal to $ 13MR^2/12$. </p>

<p>We can also obtain the body's equation of motion:
$ p=Fv=Frw$
 w is the body's angular velocity, p is the power used to drive a particle at distance r from the axis.
$Fr=p/w$ Is the torque provided by the motor, in the steady state  (no resultant torque) the DE for the system is $p/w-γw=0$ and we see w tends to $\sqrt{p/γ}$. Call this steady state value $w_0$.
Now consider time taken to accelerate the disc-shaft combination from rest to angular velocity ω. there is now a resultant torque of $I\dot{w}$,

"277183","How can I adapt classical continuum mechanics equations in order to agree with general relativity?","<p>I come from a continuum mechanics background, and I make numerical simulations of fluids/solids using the Finite Element Method. The basic equation we solve then is Newton's law of motion, written in terms of relevant vectors and tensors. Using a Lagrangian description we have the equilibrium equation: </p>

<p>$\rho \underline{\ddot u} = div(\underline{\underline{\sigma}}) + \underline{f}_v$</p>

<p>where $\underline{\ddot u}$ is the displacement 3-vector, $\underline{\underline{\sigma}}$ is the second-order Cauchy stress tensor and $\underline{f}_v$ is the 3-vector of external forces.</p>

<p>The system of equations is completed by a constitutive equation, linking the stress tensor to a measure of strain (typical solids) or a measure of strain rate (viscoelastic solids and fluids). For the sake of the example let us consider a usual linear elastic relation:</p>

<p>$\underline{\underline{\sigma}} = \mathbb{C} : \underline{\underline{\varepsilon}}$</p>

<p>with $\mathbb{C}$ being the 4th-order elasticity tensor and $\underline{\underline{\varepsilon}}$ the linear strain tensor, classically defined in the compatibility equation as the symmetric part of the displacement gradient:</p>

<p>$\underline{\underline{\varepsilon}} = \frac{1}{2}(\underline{\underline{\nabla}} u + \underline{\underline{\nabla}}^T u)$.</p>

<p>Now, the equations I stated are all I need in order to discretize the system and simulate small deformations of an arbitrary geometry under a system of forces in the context of Newtonian mechanics, using the Finite Element Method.</p>

<p>What I want to know is what is the way to adapt these equations so that they satisfy General Relativity. That is, I want to simulate the deformation of a mechanical structure when the velocities involved are close to the speed of light and/or when a very massive object is near. 
I am familiar with nonlinear elasticity if needed, but as far as tensors go I'm unfamiliar with co-variant/contra-variant notation and I prefer intrinsic notation, even though I'll take answers expressed in any way.</p>

<p>What form do the equilibrium, constitutive and compatibility equations take? Is the simulation of deformation of bodies in a relativistic context something that was properly done already? Does the elasticity tensor need to be redefined in terms of the metric tensor maybe?
I couldn't find any good reference that addresses this issue, even though I feel like this is possible to achieve. I would be very thankful for any help on this matter. </p>

  <p>Solar neutrinos originate from the nuclear fusion powering the Sun and other stars. The details of the operation of the Sun are explained by the Standard Solar Model. In short: when four protons fuse to become one helium nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such conversion releases one electron neutrino.
  The Sun sends enormous numbers of neutrinos in all directions. Each second, about 65 billion (6.5×1010) solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter on the part of the Earth that faces the Sun.[8] Since neutrinos are insignificantly absorbed by the mass of the Earth, the surface area on the side of the Earth opposite the Sun receives about the same number of neutrinos as the side facing the Sun.</p>

$ma_2=mgSin\theta-\frac{\mu}{2}mgCos\theta$.</p>

$Ma_1=(M+m)gSin\theta - \mu(M+m)gCos\theta - \frac{\mu}{2}mgcos\theta$</p>

<p>I considered the $M+m$ as a system, and so now I here omit the friction force between $M$ and $m$ because in this case it will be an internal force, and according to sir I cannot consider $M+m$ as a system because components are here in relative motion also by my equation he says the acceleration will be of centre of mass of both the blocks not the acceleration of the $M$.
Please consider both the equations mine and my teacher's and explain who is correct and how.
Now one more doubt is there was no relative motion between $m$ and $M$ then also, I think my equation will be same, am I correct in this also, or not ?</p>

"277235","How exactly do electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces interact?","<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force"" rel=""nofollow"">van der Waals force</a> is a well-understood physical phenomena, as are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics"" rel=""nofollow"">electrostatics</a>.  When particles get down to a nanoscale size and separation, van der Waals forces can be very strong and become a dominant force for causing particles to adhere to each other to surfaces or each other.</p>

<p>When particles are charged though, we instead solve for the electrostatic potential field and use that to determine the force on them.  But in this case, are van der Waals forces still present?  After all, van der Waals forces themselves <em>are</em> electrostatic phenomena - caused by induced dipole-dipole reactions between the two objects.</p>

<p>I know that in the case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLVO_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">DLVO theory</a> that the electrostatic and van der Waals effects are simply added together linearly.  However can this always be done?</p>

<p>Let's say that we have two small charged particles near each other, something like 50nm in diameter and separated by 1nm (close enough that van der Waals force is significant even if there is no net charge on either particle).  You can solve for the electrostatic force on each particle by solving for the electrostatic potential field $\nabla^2\phi=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$ with appropriate boundary conditions.  It's of course complicated for anything but the most simple of geometries, but we can always use a finite element or other numerical method to get a numerical solution.</p>

<p>The real question though is, will there still be a separate van der Waals force between these two spheres, or does solving for the electrostatic potential  account for that as well? The van der Waals force between these two particles can be simplified when the separation distance $h$ is much smaller than the particle radii $R_!$ and $R_2$:</p>

<p>$$F_{vdw}=\frac{A R_1 R_2}{6(R_1+R_2)h^2}$$</p>

<p>Where $A$ is the Hamaker constant.</p>

<p>So can I just add the $F_{vdw}$ to the electrostatic force $F_{es}$, or is there a more subtle relationship between the two?</p>

"277239","How do coaxial cable notch filters work?","<p>I am trying to understand how a coax-cable notch filter works. A schematic of the filter is here:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2LDgf.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2LDgf.png"" alt=""notch filter""></a></p>

<p>It consists of a transmission (coax) line with a deviation (<strong>D</strong>) where some part of the wave energy partially goes. The tick dashed lines are the inner conductors. By adjusting the length of the deviation undesirable frequency in the transmitted signal are suppressed due to a destructive interference which occurs between the signal which passed through the deviation and transmitted signals (signal reflects from the top of the deviation). </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
Assume we have only one frequency. Depending on the phase shift ($\delta$) created by <strong>D</strong>  how much of the undesirable wave can be  transmitted through the filter and what is the best phase shift (length of the deviation)?</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts</strong>: 
 The initial wave splits at <strong>D</strong>. A wave with the amplitude $\sqrt R \cdot E_\mathrm{in}$ enters in <strong>D</strong>. $R=1/2$ if we assume that the energy always splits equally. The transmitted wave has amplitude $\sqrt R \cdot E_\mathrm{in}$. The wave reflected from the open-end passing towards the receiver has the amplitude $\sqrt R \sqrt {R} E_\mathrm{in} e^{i\delta}$ (two times $\sqrt R$ because it splits again at the connection point and the accumulated phase shift). Now to see how much signal goes towards the receiver we find $E^2$ as follows: </p>

<p>$$E^2 = E \cdot E^* = (\sqrt R + \sqrt R \sqrt R e^{i\delta}) \cdot (\sqrt R + \sqrt R \sqrt R e^{-i\delta}) = R + R^2 + 2R \sqrt R \cos(\delta)$$</p>

<p>Then the transmission is minimal at $\delta=\pi$  </p>

"277253","The concept of ensemble","<p>I have been puzzled with the definition of ensemble in Statistical Mechanics. Different sources define it in different ways, e.g.,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Introduction To Statistical Physics (Huang), Thermodynamics and Statisitical Mechanics (Greiner): ensemble is a set of identical copies of a system (characterized by some macroscopic variables), each of which being one of the possible microstates of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics (Chandler): ensemble is a set of all possible microstates of a given system, consistent with the macroscopic variables of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical Mechanics in a Nutshell (Peliti), Statistical Physics (lectures by D. Tong): ensemble is a probability distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Wikipedia: at the beginning of the article, ensemble is also defined as a collection of identical copies of a system; afterwards, it is said to be a probability space.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to me that the correct definition is that of a probability space. I tried to translate the mathematical definition of probability space in more intuitive terms: it is a triple composed by: a sample space $\Omega$ (set of all possible outcomes of a experiment, or microstates) , event space (set of all subsets $\Omega$, it subset being a macrostate) and a probability law (a function that assigns a number between o and 1 to a element of the event space), and satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms.</p>

<p>My questions are, please:</p>

<p>1) What is the correct definition of an ensemble? </p>

<p>2) Should indeed ensemble=probability space be the correct definition, is my ""translation"" of ensemble=probability space correct? In particular, I am not sure about the interpretation of a element of the event space as a macrostate.</p>

<p>I'm interested in calculating this rotational kinetic energy for a diatomic molecule on which I'm performing molecular dynamics in a 3-dimensional box. Since the molecule is linear, the $I$ tensor is of order 2, and is hence non-invertible.

<p>Now in the same scenario, if we consider air resistance, my teacher tells me that the final velocity does not equal that of the first. (Magnitude wise) But doesn't the equation of motion stated above contradict this?  </p>

"277260","Calculating the angle $\theta$ of an incline which allows two masses to move at a constant speed?","<p>Two blocks of unequal mass are connected by a string over a smooth pulley. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mu_k$, what angle $\theta$ of the incline allows the masses to move at a constant speed? <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vpRIB.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vpRIB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So here is my attempt:</p>

<p>Essentially we have two 1D problems for each respective mass. So, for $v_x, v_y$ to be constant, that requires that $\ddot{x} = 0,$ and $\ddot{y} = 0$.</p>

<p>First, I'll consider the block of mass $m$ which moves vertically:
$m \ddot{y} = T - mg = 0 \implies$ $T = mg$.</p>

<p>Since both masses are connected by the same string we can assume that the tensile force acting on each mass is identical.</p>

<p>Now, for the block of mass $2m$ which moves only horizontally:</p>

<p>$(2m) \ddot{x} = 2mg \sin \theta - T - F_f = 0$.</p>

<p>Given that $F_f := \mu F_N$, and this block does not move vertically, $F_N = 2mg \cos \theta$. This gives us that:</p>

<p>$2mg \sin \theta - mg - \mu_k (2mg \cos \theta) = 0$, or $\, 2\sin \theta - 1 = \mu_k (2 \cos \theta)$.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure how to proceed from here. The only thing I can think of doing is dividing both sides by $2 \cos \theta$, which simplifies to:</p>

<p>$\tan \theta - \frac{1}{2 \cos \theta} = \mu_k$, but I am not sure if this is really any better.</p>

<p>Any help is very greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

"277266","Why do we divide the standard deviation by $\sqrt{n}$?","<p>I've been studying experimental physics on the book ""The art of experimental physics"" and on the chapter about error analysis there's something that has been bothering me. The author says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that we have determined the ""best value"" for the measurement, that is, $\bar{x}$, we need to estimate the uncertainty or error in this value. We start with defining one way in which the spread of data about the mean value can be characterized.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The standard deviation</strong> $s$ is defined as</p>
  
  <p>$$s = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$</p>
  
  <p>If the standard deviation is small then the spread in the measured values about the mean is small; hence, the precision in the measurement is high. Note that the standard deviation is always positive and that it has the same units as the measured values.</p>
  
  <p>The error or uncertainty in the mean value, $\bar{x}$, is the <strong>standard deviation of the mean</strong>, $s_m$, which is defined to be</p>
  
  <p>$$s_m = \dfrac{s}{n^{1/2}}$$</p>
  
  <p>where $s$ is the standard deviation and $n$ is the total number of measurements.</p>
  
  <p>The result to be reported is then</p>
  
  <p>$$\bar{x}\pm s_m.$$</p>

<p>Now, why to get the error on the quantity measured we must divide the standard deviation by $\sqrt{n}$ instead of just using the standard deviation?</p>

<p>I'm confused why the satellite remains the former form of movement, that is, the circular orbit which is an ellipse. Is there a possibility that the satellite changes its movement into a circle with larger radius or a spiral with increasing radius because of the momentum conservation law?

<li><p>Second: Why do the Boltzmann factors apply to phonons, as if they are particles? It seems to me that the temperature of the material is defined relative to the particle energies (i.e. the $ \sigma $ in $ \partial \sigma / \partial U $ is the multiplicity of the energy as the atom's fill out their orbitals; it seems unrelated to the phonons). </p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>magnetic moment has a close connection with angular momentum</em>
  called the gyromagnetic effect. This effect is expressed on a
  macroscopic scale in the Einstein-de Haas effect... In particular, when a magnetic moment is subject to a
  torque in a magnetic field that tends to align it with the applied
  magnetic field, the moment precesses (rotates about the axis of the
  applied field). This is a <strong>consequence of the concomitance of magnetic
  moment and angular momentum,</strong> that in case of charged massive particles
  corresponds to the concomitance of charge and mass in a particle.</p>

<p>This seems to signify that precession requires angular momentum $L$ and  there can be no precession if there is no (mechanical) $L$ associated to the magnetic moment. If this is correct, can you explain in detail why it is so? E.g., as a current loop has a magnetic field and magnetic moment, but no angular momentum, it can't precess?

</ul>

<p>To preface my question, I will explain the process I went through until I got my current understanding, which I want to sharpen. First, here are the main definitions of work and energy I found around the web:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Energy</strong> Is a property, or state of objects representing the ability to do work. It can be transferred to other objects, and it can be reflected
  in many forms, which are convertible.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Work</strong> is a transfer of energy from one object to another by applying force, and it is equal to $\vec{F_{x}}\cdot \vec{x}$ for a constant force, or to $\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\vec{F_{x}}\enspace d\vec{x}$ for a changing force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These definitions seem circular because <em>work</em> is a transfer of <em>energy</em>, and <em>energy</em> is the ability to do <em>work</em>. To solve this problem I adopted <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/152792/93009"">NeuroFuzzy's approach</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes when you're stuck on things, it's helpful to look at the mathematics of what's being asserted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A basic mathematical analysis of work definition $W=\vec{F_{x}}\cdot \vec{x}$ raises the following two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>When multiplying the force or the displacement by $k$, the work is also multiplied by $k$. For example, if I apply a force of $2\vec{F}$ on an object, the work will be twice as big as if I applied a force of $\vec{F}$. Also, if a given force on an object led to $\frac{1}{2}\vec{x}$ displacement, the work it did is twice as smaller as in a case it led to $\vec{x}$ displacement.</li>
<li><p>A force does a <strong>positive work</strong> when:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object displaces.</li>
<li>The force on the object is in the direction of the displacement.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>A force does <strong>negative work</strong> when:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object displaces.</li>
<li>The force on the object is in the opposite direction of the displacement.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>A force does <strong>no work</strong> when:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object does not displace.</li>
<li>No force is applied to the displacement axis.</li>
<li>Both of these conditions are met.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, when I apply a force on an object in certain circumstances (environment, other forces, time period, etc.) and the object's displacement is different than the displacement in the same conditions, only without the force, I could say that the force has <strong>influenced</strong> the displacement. It can have a <strong>""positive"" influence</strong> (if the displacement was larger than the displacement under the same conditions without applying the force) or have a <strong>""negative"" influence</strong> (if the displacement was smaller than the displacement under the same conditions, without applying the force). If I applied a force, and the displacement was equal to the displacement under the same conditions, without applying the force, then the force <strong>did not influence</strong> the displacement.</p>

<p>My intuitive conclusion of this analysis is that work is <em>the degree of influence a force has on an object's displacement</em>. If we accept my definition, and we combine it with the definitions above, we could describe work and energy as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Energy</strong> Is a property, or state of objects representing <em>the ability to apply a force that will influence an object's displacement</em>. It can be transferred to other objects, and it can be reflected
  in many forms, which are convertible.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Work</strong> is <em>the degree of influence a force has on an object's displacement</em>. When a force does work, besides the fact that it moves the object, it also transfers to the object the ability to influence other objects' displacement by applying force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a few questions about these definitions I cannot find an answer. I do not know whether the definitions are correct and the questions have answers - and then I will be grateful for answers, or the definitions are incorrect in the first place - and then I will be grateful if you could correct my definitions. </p>

<p><strong>Here are the questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Does the definition of energy mean that all energy is potential energy?</strong> Because if energy describes the <em>capability</em> of an object to do work, doesn't it means that we are talking about the <em>potential</em> of the object to do work?</li>
<li><strong>I defined energy as a property, or state of an object representing the amount of work it can do. But how could we quantify it?</strong> If, for example, a man stores within itself $100J$ of energy, does that mean he is able to apply a force of $10^{100}N$ over $10^{-98}m$? Surely a human being is not capable of applying so much force, so why we still say he stores $100J$?</li>
<li><strong>How potential energy is reflected while being potential?</strong> Can we see a difference between a person that stores $x$ energy and a person consuming that $x$ energy? An answer I heard a lot is that the mass of the person is actually its potential energy, and therefore doing physical activities, for example, is  consuming energy, and reducing the mass. But if it is correct,  wouldn't we measure energy in $kg$ or mass in $Joule$?</li>
<li>Although my definitions do explain the inner nature of work and energy, I could still mathematically describe this nature in an infinite number of ways. For example, if I describe work as $2\vec{F}_{x}\cdot \vec{x}$, I would still get to the conclusion that work is the influence a force has on an object's displacement. <strong>So why is <em>that</em> the equation?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How is consuming energy in other forms than motion work?</strong> How are heat energy, or sound waves, for example, work?</li>
</ol>

For a sheet with surface charge $\sigma = \sigma_{f}+\sigma_{b}$,
the electric flux through the gaussian pill box of area A can be expressed with Gauss's law:</p>

<p>$\oint_{S}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a}=\frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{0} }=\frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon _{0}}$</p>

<p>The pill box has an area vector $\vec{A}=\pm \hat{z}A$:
 ""-"" if the area A is facing in the negative z direction and ""+"" if the area A is facing in the positive z direction.</p>

<p>We know that the sheet produces its own electric field due to the surface charge $\sigma$. This electric field is in the +z direction above the sheet and in the -z direction below the sheet.</p>

<p>Now, there is, without Griffith made explicitly clear, an external electric field below the charge sheet.
This electric field is in the z direction and the field lines from this external electric field 'pass' through the charge sheet.</p>

<p>Here is where things gets confusing:</p>

<p>Griffith asserts that$ E^{\perp}_{above}-E^{\perp}_{below}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon _{0}}$</p>

"277387","How do we come to $c$ in the Lorentz Factor in relativity?","<p>While reading a post explaining <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/241772/"">time dilation in relativity</a>. The author explains why we add  $c$ to get to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space"" rel=""nofollow"">Minkowski Metric</a>. He explains it as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so we multiply time by the speed of light $c$ so the product $ct$ has units of metres</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that the time dimension can be considered in the same terms (units) as the spacial dimensions.</p>

<p>My question is how we came to use $c$ and not some other arbitrary speed. Why $c$ gets used in the Lorentz Factor. I believe it comes from Maxwells Equations for Electromagnetism but correct me if I'm wrong and point me to the right path.</p>

<p>the Lorentz factor: $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$</p>

<p>And time dilation equation in special relativity $$t' = t\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}  = \frac{t}{\gamma}$$</p>

"277393","Transmission of Power by Hoses","<p>A pump feeds two hoses each of which is 45m long and is fitted with a nozzle. Each nozzle has a coefficient of velocity of 0.97 and discharges a 37.5mm diam jet of water at 24m/s when the nozzle is at the same level as the pump. If the power lost in overcoming friction in the hoses is not to exceed 20 per cent of the hydraulic power available at the inlet end of the hoses, calculate<br>
(a) the diameter of the hoses, taking f = 0.007, (b) the power required to drive the pump if its efficiency is 70 per cent and it draws its water supply from a level 3m below the nozzle.  </p>

<p>Here are my workings for part (a) of the question.</p>

<p>Head lost at nozzle = Hp = H - 4fLv^2/ D2g<br>
or Hp = Head at inlet to hoses - frictional head loss in each hose.<br>
Cv = 0.97 and Jet Velocity V = Cv (2g * Hp)^1/2, 
so then I worked out Hp from this 31.208m<br>
For continuity of flow, flow from hoses = flow from nozzle, so v = V (d^2/ D^2) and v = 0.03375/ D^2<br>
I have then put this in the frictional head loss formula 4fLV^2/ D2g and this gives 1.43521875 * 10^-3/ D^5 * 19.62<br>
Note 2g = 19.62 and H = 5 * frictional head loss<br>
So lastly I put this in the formula  Hp = H - 4fLv^2/ D2g and solved for D and I got 98.7mm for the hose diameter.<br>
Is this on the correct path for Part (a) of the question?  </p>

<p>How do I work out the power for Part (b)?<br>
I'm not looking for the answer, but just some ideas that can help me find a solution.   </p>

<p>I am thoroughly confused about certain aspects of the situation described in this diagram in which a block is placed on a wedge inclined at an angle θ. (Assume <strong><em>no friction everywhere</em></strong>) </p>

<p>Let us consider a few different cases:</p>

<p>Firstly, when the wedge is accelerating toward the left, if I were to observe the system from the ground(assumed to be an inertial reference frame), what will I see? Will I see the block stay put on the wedge and accelerating along with it toward the left or will I see it move down the inclined plane, which itself is moving leftwards? </p>

<p>Secondly, in some problems, they have <em>mentioned</em> that the wedge is accelerating ""down the inclined plane with acceleration $a$ <strong>w.r.t</strong> the wedge"". In such problems, I pick the wedge as my reference frame, introduce a pseudo force and deal with the situation. However, if I were to observe the block from the ground, what would its motion look like to me?</p>

<p>Thirdly, when drawing the free body diagram of a block that is given to be ""moving down an inclined plane"", in which direction should I assume its acceleration? Directly downward or along the plane? </p>

<p>Fourthly, if given that the block doesn't ""slip over the wedge"", what is the condition to be used? </p>

<p>As you may see from all this, I am spectacularly confused about all this changing reference frames and accelerations. If anyone could please sum it up concisely, it would be so so helpful for me. I hope that I have conveyed my doubts clearly. If more clarity is required, please let me know and I will edit my question accordingly. MUCH thanks in advance :) Regards. </p>

Last problem I'm bumping my head against is the following:</p>

<p>a particle with mass $M$ and energy E is travelling along the z-axis. At a certain point it decays into two particles with mass $m = \frac M 3$ .
Let $\theta$ be the angle between one of those particle's direction and the z-axis in the c.o.m. frame</p>

<p>Find:</p>

<p>a) $\theta$ value for which the two particles have the same velocity in the laboratory frame; evaluate the value of said velocity;</p>

<p>b) the angle between the two particles in the laboratory frame for a given $\theta$;</p>

<p>Starting to analyze the problem in the c.o.m. frame, and we have that:</p>

<p>conservation of momentum implies $p_1$=$-p_2$ </p>

<p>Then, said particles will have the same energy as well, which is $e=\frac M 2$</p>

<p>I can evaluate $|p|$= $\sqrt{(E^2 -m^2c^2)}$      </p>

<p>At this point I'm kinda in a dead end: I don't know how to link the conditions in the two different frames, let alone solving point B.
I suppose that due to symmetry the velocities will be the same if $\theta$=$90°$, but if I were ask to write it rigorously I wouldn't be able to do it in the blink of an eye (if it's true, that is)</p>

<p>If I'm right then $p_1 = (e,0,p,0)$ and $p_2 = (e,0,-p,0)$ in the c.o.m. frame, and their values in the laboratory one is found after a Lorentz boost along the z-axis:
 $p'_1 = (e',0,p,-eβγ)$ and $p'_2 = (e',0,-p,-eβγ)$
So that's how I would ""proceed"", but my mind is still full of doubts and I can't write down a proper solution, anyone willing to make things a bit more clear? Thank you in advance.</p>

(with $\varphi_1(x)$ and $\varphi_2(x)$ - and their respective complex conjugates - solutions of the K-G equations) to obtain the following equation (by subtracting the second to the first one):
\begin{equation} \varphi_2^*(x)(\Box \varphi_1(x)) - \varphi_1(x) (\Box \varphi_2^*(x))=0 \end{equation}
At this point, adopting the covariant/contravariant formalism for the $\Box$-operator ($\Box=\partial_i\partial^i$) and defining $\varphi_2^*(x)\overleftrightarrow{\partial^i}\varphi_1(x) = \varphi_2^*(x)\partial^i\varphi_1(x) - \varphi_1(x)\partial^i\varphi_2^*(x)$, the last equation is rewritten as follows:

I'm currently doing my master thesis in physics, studying Topological Insulators. <br/>
For the study of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations visible in the magnetoresistance, it is usual to perform a Landau level (LL) fan diagram. The fitting yields values for the phase factor of the oscillations and the slope allows to determine the Fermi wave vector and, consequently, the carrier density. This is what I'm currently interested in. 
Ando (<em>J. Phys. Soc. Jpn 82 (2013)</em>) says that for a topological 2D surface, the carrier density and Fermi vector are related by:<br/>
$n_{2D}=1/(2\pi)^2\pi k_{F}^2$ <br/>
It is said that this should be multiplied by 2 if the surface states doesn't have a topological origin (which would lead to the well known relation used in semiconductors...). My question is why should we not take into account the spin degeneracy in topological surfaces? <br/>
Is it possibly due to the lifting of the degeneracy by the spin-orbit coupling anywhere but the TRIMs?

<p>I have a very loose grasp of Unruh radiation and relativity, but this is my best attempt at a qualitative explanation of what's going on:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a truncated conical resonant cavity into which magnetron-generated radiation enters</li>
<li>Photons travel axially, bouncing back and forth</li>
<li>Due to the fact that as you travel toward the wider end of the cavity, more Unruh modes can fit, the photon gains inertial mass and loses momentum (could someone clarify this point?)</li>
<li>Linear momentum conservation would require a force opposite the direction of the decelerated photon's trajectory, providing an axial thrust against the narrow end of the cavity (is this even correct?)</li>
</ol>

<p>How is it possible that the photons have an inertial mass? Do we know? Doesn't this violate special relativity?</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03449v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> for what I think is a <em>fairly</em> accessible explanation. An excerpt of the discussion is provided below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To explain in a more intuitive manner: MiHsC predicts that as photons travel
  from the narrow end on the left of the emdrive to the wide end on the right
  (see the lower arrows in Figure 1) their inertial mass increases as more Unruh
  wavelengths fit at the righthand wide end of the cavity. In the figure this
  is shown by the arrow being thicker on the right. This change though, has
  violated the conservation of momentum, so we must now apply a force towards
  the narrow end to slow the photon down and conserve momentum. When the
  photons bounce off the wide end and move leftwards again towards the narrow
  end they lose inertial mass because fewer Unruh waves fit at the narrow end, so
  to conserve momentum it is now necessary to apply a force, again towards the
  narrow end, to speed the photons up. </p>

<p>The book mentions that you can use the fact that $1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}=(1+\frac{v}{c})(1-\frac{v}{c})$ to help in the derivation, so that $$\gamma=(1+\frac{v}{c})^{-\frac{1}{2}}\cdot(1-\frac{v}{c})^{-\frac{1}{2}}.$$ This seems to lend itself quite nicely to a binomial expansion, which I am confident in doing, but it still eludes me how to link this to $10^n$.

Hence for an isolated system of two bodies total linear momentum should always be conserved.</p>

<p>The statement above implies that a two-body potential cannot be anything else than $V(\textbf{r}_1-\textbf{r}_2)$ where $\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2$ are the position vectors of body 1 and body 2 respevtively. Since, the momentum of an isolated system is always conserved, implies that the Lagrangian must be translationally invariant. Therefore, any arbitary function $V(\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2)$ is never posssible. Is this correct? Is there any exception?</p>

<p>Using the same argument of homogeneity of space, is it correct to assert that a n-body potential cannot have any arbitrary form $V(\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2,...,\textbf{r}_n)$ but must be of the form that depends on $\textbf{r}_i-\textbf{r}_j$ (for all i anf j)?</p>

<p>$$ |ψ&gt; = |0&gt; + |1&gt; \\
|φ&gt; = |0&gt; - |1&gt; $$</p>

<p>Each of these two wavefunctions has density matrices, which can be written (in the 0,1 basis) as:</p>

<p>$$ \rho_{\psi} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
    1       &amp; 1 \\
    1       &amp; 1

    1       &amp; -1 \\

<p>If I look at a coherent superposition of my two superpositions in ket notation: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|ψ&gt;+|φ&gt;)
\implies |0&gt; $$</p>

<p>But I'm interested in working strictly in the density matrix picture. I want to add the density matrices without having to look at the kets at all. At first glance, I naively thought that I could simiply add them together in the same way as the kets:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{1}{2} (\rho_{\psi} +\rho_{\phi}) = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}

    0       &amp; 1

<p>When I think about the result of this I get confused. I'm adding all of the elements of my density matrix; and looking at the subtraction in the off-diagonals, the coherence terms of each state are certainly talking to each other (which indicates to me that there's quantum interference). But half of me thinks that adding two separate density matrices is simply constructing a mixture (and consequently the quantum coherence isn't interfering). </p>

<p>Doing the math you can see that this is different from the density matrix produced by summing the ket states: </p>

<p>$$ \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
    1       &amp; 0 \\
    0       &amp; 0 
\end{bmatrix}$$</p>

<p>I can almost come up with a way to do it, but the answer is a lot uglier than I was expecting, and I'm stuck at the very end. </p>

<p>Looking at our summed states: |summed> = (|ψ>+|φ>)(&lt;φ|+&lt;ψ|)
$$ = |φ&gt;&lt;φ| +|φ&gt;&lt;ψ|+ |ψ&gt;&lt;φ|+|ψ&gt;&lt;ψ| \\
= \rho_φ + \rho_ψ +|φ&gt;&lt;ψ|+ |ψ&gt;&lt;φ| $$</p>

<p>$$
|φ&gt;&lt;ψ| = \frac{1}{&lt;φ||ψ&gt;}|φ&gt;&lt;φ||ψ&gt;&lt;ψ| =  \frac{1}{&lt;φ||ψ&gt;}\rho_ψ \rho_φ$$</p>

<p>$$
\rho_φ + \rho_ψ + \frac{1}{&lt;φ||ψ&gt;}\rho_ψ \rho_φ +  \frac{1}{&lt;ψ||φ&gt;}\rho_φ \rho_ψ$$</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to express &lt;ψ||φ> in terms of ρφ and ρψ. I'm assuming its some combo of trace and multiplication, since Tr[ρφρψ] = 2 &lt;ψ||φ>&lt;φ||ψ>.  </p>

$$ \int Dx\, e^{iS[x]}. $$</p>

<p>Define $x(t)=x_{\text{cl}}(t)+\eta(t)$, then we can Taylor expand the action about the classical path

where, by definition of the classical path, the second term vanishes. So what we need to evaluate is the third term. So far I'm basically copying from the book.</p>

<p>Ok, so let's now put the expression of $S[x]$ inside to evaluate the second order variation:</p>

"277565","Where is the evidence that the electron is pointlike?","<p>I'm writing a piece about the electron, and I'm having trouble finding evidence to back up the claim that the evidence is pointlike. </p>

<p>People <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electron&amp;oldid=736920611#Fundamental_properties"" rel=""nofollow"">tend to say</a> <em>the observation of a single electron in a Penning trap shows the upper limit of the particle's radius to be 10<sup>-22</sup> meters</em>. But when you look at Hans Demelt’s <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/dehmelt-lecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Nobel lecture</a> you read about an <em>extrapolation</em> from the measured g value, which relies upon <em>""a plausible relation given by Brodsky and Drell (1980) for the simplest composite theoretical model of the electron""</em>. This extroplation yields an electron radius of R ≈ 10<sup>-20</sup> cm, but it isn't a measurement. Especially when <em>""the electron forms a 1 μm long wave packet, 30 nm in diameter""</em>.  </p>

<p>It's similar when you look at <a href=""http://slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacpubs/2500/slac-pub-2534.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The anomalous magnetic moment and limits on fermion substructure</a> by Brodsky and Drell. You can read things like this: <em>""If the electron or muon is in fact a composite system, it is very different from the familiar picture of a bound state formed of elementary constituents since it must be simultaneously light in mass and small in spatial extension"".</em> The conclusion effectively says <em>if an electron is composite it must be small</em>. But there's no actual evidence for a pointlike electron. </p>

As I understand it, black holes are always spheric and lack magnetic fields but they stars which formed them don't need to be exactly spheric nor lack magnetic fields.
So the point is, according to <em>Blackholes and warped spacetime</em> of Kip Thorne, he claims that information regarding the star that collapses is transformed into gravitational waves and hence, it gets out of the blackhole.
However, in <em>The nature of space time</em> of Hawking and Penrose, Hawking makes the point that information (hair) is lost when stars collapse. According to classical physics, this information gets stored within the black hole whereas semiclassical physics tells us that through the evaporation of the black hole, this information will be lost and unretrievable.
So what is exactly what we know for sure? Thorne or Hawking's point?
I am really confused about the information that gravitational gaves actually have.</p>

<p>$$
y'' + \frac{k\cdot y}{m} = 0
$$</p>

<p>where $m$ is the mass of the pendulum ball, $k$ is the proportionality factor from Hook's law, and  $y$ is the elongation from equilibrium position. A possible solution is</p>

<p>$$
y(t) = y_{max} \sin{(\frac{2 \pi}{T}t + \rho})
$$</p>

<p><strong>How to derive an expression for the maximum speed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Attempt:</strong></p>

<p>I start by differentiating $y(t)$ to get $v(t)$:</p>

<p>$$
v(t) = \frac{2\pi}{T}y_{max} \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{T}t + \rho \right)
$$</p>

<p>Then I optimize $v(t)$ by settings its derivative equal to zero: $\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = 0$ </p>

<p>$$
\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = - \frac{4 \pi^2}{T^2}y_{max} \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{T}t + \rho \right) = 0
$$</p>

<p>However, I am not sure how to go on from here to actually obtain an expression for the maximum speed. Intuitively I understand that the speed is highest when the pendulum reaches the equilibrium position, when $y=0$, or equivalently when $a=0$ - of course, the acceleration is zero at $y_{max}$ also, so perhaps I should use the two conditions that both $a=y=0$, somehow?</p>

<p>One of the ways to derive this law is to concider a spherical surface at the centre of which there is a point charge.</p>

<p>Because of the symmetry the field has the same value in every point of the Gaussian surface.</p>

Griffiths claims that for an electron orbiting an origin, the centripetal acceleration is sustained by the electrical forces
$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{R^{2}}=m_{e}\frac{v^{2}}{R}$</p>

<p>Note that he made no references as to what this electron $-e$ is orbiting with respect to. However, from the expression above with the $e^{2}$ and by Coloumb's law, it can be guessed that there is a charge at the origin. 
Otherwise, it is nonsensical to speak of electrical force of an electron. It is always the electric force <strong>between</strong> at least two charges.
The charge, I think, should be $-e$ for if it were not, the expression 
$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{R^{2}}=m_{e}\frac{v^{2}}{R}$
would be negative.
The only caveat is if everything is in scalar form.</p>

<p>He goes on to hypotheses that if this orbit were in the presence of a magnetic field in the z-direction, this magnetic force would be added to the above expression
$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{R^{2}}=m_{e}\frac{v^{2}}{R}$.</p>

<p>Recall that the magnetic force is given by $-e\left ( \vec{v} \times \vec{B}\right )$ for a negative charge -e. 
The magnetic field is perpendicular to the orbit of -e and $\vec{v}$ the velocity vector of -e. 
Then we have -evB.</p>

<p>But adding this force to the expression 
$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{R^{2}}$
would result in
$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{R^{2}}
-evB$. </p>

<p>Griffiths, however, has$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{R^{2}}

which I cannot understand.</p>

<p>Now I was able to find the eq. of geodetics (or directly by Christoffel formulas calculation or by the Lagrangian for a point particle). And I verified that such space constant coordinate point is a geodetic.</p>

<p>Now, for the second point I considered $$ ds^2=0 $$ to separate the $$dt$$ and find the separation time. But I don't know how to solve for a generic path of a light ray. So I considered that maybe the text wants a light ray travelling along x axis and the second along y axis.</p>

<p>I checked in other sources and all people make the same, by considering a light ray along x-axis and then setting $$dy=dz=0$$.</p>

<p>But when I substitute these in my geodesic equations it turns out that they are not true even at first order in A! So these people that consider a light ray travelling along x-axis, such as in an interferometer, are not considering a light geodesic. All of this if and only if my calculations are true.</p>

<p>So I know that if $$ ds^2=0 $$  I have a light geodesic. And so it should solve my eq. of geodesics. But if I restrain my motion on x axis what I can say is that the $$ ds^2=0 $$  condition now is on a submanifold of my manifold. So, the light wave that I consider doesn't not move on a geodesic of the original manifold but on one of the x axis. This is the only thing that came in my mind.</p>

So, I was curious, just how much radioactivity is each of these TIG rods producing?</p>

<p>Below is my own personal research transcribed from a LaTeX document I created.  (I was practicing math, physics, and <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com"">TeX</a> all at the same time.) :-)</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the value I calculated (564.5 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"" rel=""nofollow"">Bq</a>) appear accurate? (i.e. correct math and physics calculations)</li>

<li>Six of the ten decays create an alpha particle.  Does this mean that the TIG rod is ""producing"" six $^{4}$He nuclei per decay event? (Imagining rod being ""filled"" with helium...)</li>
</ol>

<h2>From my LaTeX document:</h2>

<p>The TIG rod is a cylinder 2.4 mm in diameter and 175 mm long.  It is made of <a href=""https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/weldingrod.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">2% thorium dioxide</a> (ThO$_{2}$) and the rest is tungsten.</p>

<p>Assumptions made:</p>

<ul>
<li>The proportions of tungsten and thorium dioxide are by volume, not mass.</li>
<li>Thorium is comprised of a single isotope, $^{232}$Th, with a standard atomic weight of 232.0377 u.</li>
<li>Oxygen has a standard atomic weight of 15.9995 u.  This is based on the natural terrestrial occurrence of the three stable isotopes of oxygen.</li>
<li>Thorium's radioactive half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"" rel=""nofollow"">1.405 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ years</a>.</li>
<li>Tungsten and oxygen are stable--all radioactivity is from the thorium.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  Modern accurate measurements indicate that all five naturally-occurring isotopes of tungsten are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_tungsten"" rel=""nofollow""><em>very mildly</em> radioactive</a>, with each having a $t_{1/2}$ > 10$^{18}$ years.  This can be ignored for the purposes of this discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Thorium dioxide's density ($\rho$) is <a href=""http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1962/3445603644849.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">10.00 g/cm$^{3}$</a>.</li>
<li>Avogadro's constant ($N_{A}$) is 6.02214 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$</li>
<li>There are 3.15576 $\times$ 10$^{7}$ seconds in a year.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, calculate the volume of the rod.  $V_{cylinder} = \pi r^{2}h$.</p>

<p>$$ V_{rod} = \pi \times (1.2 \text{ mm})^{2} \times 175 \text{ mm}
 = 791.6835 \text{ mm}^{3} = 0.7916835 \text{ cm}^{3}$$
Next, find the fractional volume of the ThO$_{2}$.</p>

<p>$$ V_{ThO_{2}} = 2\% \text{ of } V_{rod} = 0.02 \times 0.7916835 \text{ cm}^{3} 
= 1.583367 \times 10^{-2} \text{ cm}^{3} $$
Find the mass of the ThO$_{2}$.</p>

<p>$$ m_{ThO_{2}} = \rho_{ThO_{2}} \times V_{ThO_{2}} = 10.00 \dfrac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^{3}} \times 1.583367 \times 10^{-2} \text{ cm}^{3} 
= 0.1583367\text{ g} $$
Calculate the mass fraction of thorium in ThO$_{2}$.
$$ M_{Th} = \dfrac{u_{Th}}{u_{Th} + 2 u_{O}} = \dfrac{232.0377\text{ u}}
{232.0377\text{ u} + 2 \times 15.9995\text{ u}} = 0.8788 ~M_{ThO_{2}} $$</p>

<p>Find the mass of the thorium given its fraction of the mass of ThO$_{2}$.
$$ m_{Th} = 0.8788 \times 0.1583367\text{ g} = 0.1391463\text{ g} $$
Calculate the number of moles of Th.  This is calculated by dividing the mass by its standard atomic weight.
$$ n_{Th} = \dfrac{m_{Th}}{u_{Th}} = \dfrac{0.1391463\text{ g}}{232.0377\text{ u}} 
= 5.99671 \times 10^{-4}\text{ mol}  $$
Multiply moles by Avogadro's Constant to find the number of thorium atoms in the rod.
$$ N_{Th} = (5.99671 \times 10^{-4}\text{ mol}) \times  
(6.02214 \times 10^{23}\text{ mol}^{-1}) = 3.6113035 \times 10^{20} $$
Convert thorium's half life from years to seconds.
$$ t_{1/2} = (1.405 \times 10^{10} \text{ yr}) \times \left(3.15576 \times 10^{7}

The activity (in Bequerels) is calculated by multiplying the number of thorium atoms by the natural logarithm of 2 divided by its half-life.
$$ A_{Th} = 3.6113035 \times 10^{20} \times \dfrac{0.69314718}{4.43395977 \times 10^{17}\text{ s}} = 564.544 \text{ Bq} $$
Thus, there are about 565 radioactive decays of $^{232}$Th each second in the thoriated TIG rod.

"277647","Relationship between electric field lines and permitivities of media","<p>Some books define (although some do not) the electric field flux as the number of electric field lines passing through a given area. Suppose that there is an electric filed created by a charge plate and the filed lines emerging from the plate are passing through two adjacent media having two different permitivities. In this case, the electric fields observed in two media should be different due to the differences in electric permitivities. So when the electric filed line model is applied here, which tells something about the field strength, we see that number of filed lines in two media are different. Does this mean that electric filed lines are created or destroyed at the interface between media? I know obviously this is not the case, but how can we explain this situation? Should we apply the electric flux model separately to two media considering individually? </p>

"277650","Gravity and Electric Potential Analogy and gap","<p>I am trying to learn basics of electrical engineering and even after reading lots of material I have some (perhaps) basic questions.</p>

<p>Let me precede the questions with my understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both gravity and electric field are field forces and I see quite an analogy in the way they behave, especially the fact that how potential is dependent on the position of an object in the field. </li>
<li>Furthermore I see resistance as 'friction' or 'viscosity'. So when I visualize electric current passing thru various resistors, I see mass/particles falling thru liquid of different viscosity. </li>
</ul>

<p>With that, my questions are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Question on series circuit: Imagine numerous particles (analogous to electrons) falling thru a series of liquids of same volume &amp; height but different viscosity (analogous to resistors). Now, I can intuitively understand how the overall rate of flow of particles (or current) will depend on viscosity of each liquid (i.e. the relation of current - I - and all the resistances under constant V), and I can also understand that based on the viscosity of each liquid, particles will lose different amounts of kinetic energy and that at the end the particle will lose all it's potential energy. But the change in gravitational potential energy of a particle at any point is only dependent on the distance between falling object and ground and not on viscosity. But the electric potential drop across each resistor in series circuit varies based on the resistance, why is it so; why isn't potential drop here simply based on the distance of charge in electric field (is it that the electric field here is more complex than what would simply be between 2 points that don't have free electrons &amp; ions in between? and therefore the gravity analogy can't explain it). What happens in a resistor that can cause potential change (I know the part where we say that electrons in resistors collide more frequently and the flow is restricted but why would these collision cause potential drop, they should only cause a transfer of kinetic energy)
I have gone over other analogies also - like water pump, car pool lane, but I couldn't get the answer. </p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps rephrasing the above, in a circuit with single resistor, that single resistor can cause voltage drop equal to that of battery/voltage source, but when another one is added the previous resistor doesn't cause equal voltage drop (I get Ohm's law, and understand that current will be reduced when another resistor will be added, but still I do not get how it impacts amount of work done to move a charge in electric field i.e. voltage)
Can someone explain a series circuit using the gravity analogy.</p></li>
<li><p>In one of the physics lectures it was told that the electrons flowing thru the circuit are not produced by voltage source/batteries. While in another electrochemistry lecture, when explaining Redox and half reactions, I suppose it was told that electrons from the reaction flow thru the circuit. So which one is true, do the same free electrons from the conductor cycle thru the battery and other elements or is it combination of electrons from battery and free electrons of conductor that circle thru the circuit.</p></li>

"277656","Constructive interference and maximums of interference","<p>I am getting really confused about the experiment of Michelson and Morley. As I understand it, we should be able to observe a destructive interference because light beams go through different optical paths.
Destructive interferences form minimums of interference whereas constructive interferences form maximums.
Then I translate here what my book says:
""After the rotation of $90^\circ$ degrees of the interferometer, we should see a number of fringes equal to the times the width of the phase shift, which is $$\delta\ =\ 4\pi \frac{L_0}{λ} \frac{v^2}{c^2}$$ (which is the sum in absolute value of the longitudinal and transversal phase shift, as I understand it) contains $2\pi$, since according to the following equation, Intensity $$I\ =\ I_0\ cos^2 \frac{\delta}{2}$$ and $$\delta\ =\ \frac{2\pi}{λ} \Delta R,$$ where $2 \pi$ is the phase shift between 2 consecutive maximums of interference""</p>

<p>So what I don't understand is the last line. If a destructive interference is expected, shouldn't we be looking for minimums(that is what destructives interference forms)? Why here are we assuming that the expected result is a constructive interference? 
Please don't delete this post since I really need help on this. </p>

<p>Having the unperturbed velocity field in cylindrical coordinates $\mathbf{u_0}=u_0(R)\mathbf{\hat{\phi}}$, and the small perturbation $\mathbf{u}$ in $\mathbf{\hat{R}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{\phi}}$ directions, one can write the linearized Navier-Stokes equation (neglecting the perturbations of the density and gravitational potential) as:

"277673","Schwinger-Dyson equations in the Coulomb gauge","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As far as I know (and please correct me if something is wrong!) the usual narrative to deal with perturbation theory in QED with the Coulomb gauge goes as follows:</p>

<p>First, the gauge field is fixed to
$$
\nabla\cdot\vec A(x)=0\tag{1}
$$
so that the equations of motion read
$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla^2 A^0(x)&amp;=J^0(x)\\
\partial^2\vec A(x)&amp;=P(\nabla)\vec J(x)
\end{aligned} \tag{2}
$$
where $\partial^2=\partial_0^2-\nabla^2$ and
$$P^{ij}(\vec k)=\delta^{ij}-\frac{k^ik^j}{\vec k^2}\tag{3}$$
is the projector into the transverse part of the current.</p>

<p>Now, the equation of motion for $A^0$ is not dynamical, and so we integrate that field out by setting
$$
A^0=\frac{1}{\nabla^2}J^0 \tag{4}
$$
into the Lagrangian, generating the well-known non-local Coulomb term.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the true field is $\vec A$, and its propagator is
$$
\Delta^{ij}(k)=\frac{P^{ij}(\vec k)}{k^2+i\epsilon} \tag{5}
$$</p>

<p>The important point is the following: the non-local term is, for all practical purposes, equivalent to an extended propagator $\Delta^{\mu\nu}$ such that it coincides with $\Delta^{ij}$ on the spatial components, and
$$
\Delta^{00}(\vec k)=\frac{1}{\vec k^2} \tag{6}
$$</p>

<p>One can show that this extended propagator is the same as the covariant propagator in the Feynman gauge $\xi=1$, up to (non-covariant) terms proportional to $k^\mu$, and therefore the theory is, after all, covariant.</p>

<p>While it is still true that $\Delta^{ij}=\langle A^i A^j\rangle$, now there is no operator corresponding to $\Delta^{00}$.</p>

<hr>

<h2>My doubt: An example</h2>

<p>So far so good (?). Now, the cancellation of the $k^\mu$ terms can be proven, on general terms, thanks to the Ward-Takahashi identities, which state that general correlation functions are zero when contracted with $k^\mu$ (kind of: they need not be zero, but their form is highly constrained).</p>

<p>But it seems to me that this identities cannot be naively used in the Coulomb gauge, because we don't have $A^0$ any more, and so correlation functions do not include the $\mu=0$ component. In other words, the true correlation functions are
$$
\langle 0|T\ A^i(x)A^j(y)\psi(z)\cdots|0\rangle \tag{7}
$$
and it is impossible to contract this with $\partial_\mu$. So I guess we can still write
$$
\partial_\mu\langle J^\mu \psi_1\psi_2\cdots\rangle=\text{contanct-term} \tag{8}
$$
but, in the Coulomb gauge, there is no simple relation bewtween $\langle J^\mu\cdots\rangle$ and $\langle A^\mu\cdots\rangle$. In generalised gauges we have
$$
\langle A^\mu \cdots\rangle=\frac{1}{\partial^2}\langle J^\mu\cdots\rangle+\text{contanct-term} \tag{9}
$$
but this is no longer true in the Coulomb gauge.</p>

<p>Or put it another way: we can write the WT identities with $J^\mu$ instead of $A^\mu$, but this doesn't take us much further: in order to show cancellation of $k^\mu$ terms we must write the correlation function in terms of $A^\mu$. In covariant gauges this is easy: using $-\partial^2 A^\mu=J^\mu$, we can replace any $A^\mu$ in a corralation function, up to a propagator $1/k^2$ and a contact term (due to the $T$ symbol). But this is no longer true in the Coulomb gauge: for one thing, $\langle A^\mu\cdots\rangle$ is undefined for $\mu=0$.</p>

<p>After all, the equations $(8)$ and $(9)$ are an essential ingredient for the proof of the fact that $k^\mu$ terms do not contribute to measurable predictions (for example, see Srednicki's book, chapters 67-68; in particular, eqs. [67.9] - [67.12]).</p>

<hr>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>In a more general context, what can be said about the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the Coulomb gauge? Are they still valid? can we use $A^\mu$, or must we restrict ourselves to $A^i$? How can we efficiently use the fact that the non-local interaction is equivalent to an extended propagator? How is this implemented on the level of the DS equations instead of on the level of Feynman diagrams?</p>

<p>As far as I know, for general covariant gauges the DS equations work just fine, and they are valid for the four components of $A^\mu$.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Further info</h2>

<p>Weinberg, in his QFT book, chapter 9.6 introduces an auxiliary field $A^0$ and groups it together with the old, physical $A^i$ in such a way that $A^\mu$ can be formally thought of as a vector field, with $A^0$ behaving like it was its true temporal component (see page 415, in particular the discussion below 9.6.6). This is pretty much what I would like: I want to use the Coulomb gauge, but I want to use $A^\mu$ as well, in order to be able to use the WT identities or any DS equation in general. But here Weinberg uses path integrals instead of operators. Sigh.</p>

<p>If any one knows some good source where QED in the Coulomb gauge is thoroughly discussed (without path integrals!) it would be very <em>very</em> welcome.</p>

Both the classical and the quantum models are based on the same Hamiltonian, describing the Coulomb potential. The classical model however misses a lot of important properties like the discrete energy spectrum. The quantum model does the job right (of course, the simple Coulomb model only works well to some limit, but that is another story).</p>

<p>Apparently, to obtain the correct observables like the energy spectrum one only needs to know that the right description is quantum. No new parameters which are model-specific appear (Plank's constant is universal).  </p>

<p>Speaking more generally and more loosely, the quantum description becomes relevant at a very small scale. It seems natural to expect that a lot more details are visible at this scale. However, the input of our model, the Hamiltonian, stays basically the same. Only the general theoretical framework changes.</p>

<p>Probably, the question may be rephrased as follows. Why do the quantization rules exist? By the quantization rules I mean the procedures that allow to go from the classical description to the quantum in a very uniform fashion that is applicable to many systems?</p>

"277707","How is angular momentum stored in the superfluid component of pulsars?","<p>I am trying to understand current theories about why pulsars glitch. I have come across two explanations that I'm assuming are complementary, but which I am having trouble reconciling. </p>

<ol>
<li>The inner super-fluid component is spinning faster than the crust. Occasionally, the two briefly bind, during which angular momentum is transferred. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is based off of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(astronomy)"" rel=""nofollow"">wikepedia</a> entry for ""glitch"". Intuitively, I picture this as two aligned globes, with one spinning inside the other. </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The inner super-fluid component contains ""currents"", which rotate around vortex lines. Normally, these vortex lines are pinned to the crust. However, when a large number of them unpin at once, they transfer some of the angular momentum of the currents to the crust, resulting in a glitch. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is coming from the <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...409..345A"" rel=""nofollow"">vortex creep model</a> (summary in section 2). It is hard to describe in words how I picture this, so I include a picture below. I imagine these spikes are vortex lines... And that's about as far as I can get. </p>

<p>Are these vortex lines rotating with the crust, so that a given ""packet"" of super-fluid both has a global rotation about the star's axis of rotation, as well as a local rotation around the vortex line? If so, is this global rotation what is referenced in explanation 1)?</p>

<p>Additionally, 1) seems to be reliant on the crust and super-fluid component being unbound from each-other (except during a glitch), but 2) seems to imply that the components are bound to each other (except during a glitch). This seems to imply a fundamental misinterpretation of something on my part, but I'm not sure exactly what. </p>

<p>how does one determine the representation of $(\gamma^{ab})_\alpha{}^\beta \partial_\beta$?

<p>The point is that we usually end up with a list of measurements $x_1,\dots,x_n$, being $n$ the number of measurements we made.</p>

<p>The important thing is: each $x_i$ corresponds actually to the <em>same thing</em> being measured. It is just that we measure the same thing several times and write down the values.</p>

<p>Once we have this list of measurements we take means, compute standard deviations and so on.</p>

<p>Now, when I asked <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/277266/"">this question</a> on the answer it was said that when we make the measurements, <em>each</em> $x_i$ is a random variable and the mean is actually another random variable.</p>

<p>I didn't understand that. In truth, my understanding of random variables is quite limited (all I remember of what I once studied on the topic is that random variables are functions defined in a probability space).</p>

"277727","Use of wormholes to violate conservation of energy","<p>The change in energy of an object as it moves from point A in space to point B in space is the integral of the net force it experiences over it's path of travel. If an object returns to it's starting location, and the force field it is within is constant over time, then it is provable through calculus that the change in energy of the object will be zero for force induced by electric fields, magnetic fields, and for gravity exerted by non-rotating bodies. The theorem which proves this, however, makes assumptions about the topology of space: space must be continuous (without holes), and that there's no method to jump from one point in space to another point in space.</p>

<p>In the case of a rotating mass, energy is still conserved as whatever energy an object gains from the rotation will be lost by the rotating object. This is why the moon is further from earth than it once was, and why the earth spins slower than it once did. In the case of a wormhole, however, the topology of space is radically altered. Assuming that one could create the negative energy density necessary to create the wormhole, is it possible to use a wormhole to violate conservation of energy?</p>

  <p>One of my school exam questions asked to show(mathematically of physically) that the intensity of unpolarised light passing through a polarizer is halved. I found this rather difficult to prove, but i made an attempt anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MY ATTEMPT: Malus law: if we have 2 polarizers P1 and P2 inclined at angle x with each other, the intensity passing through P2 is $I_o$$cos^2(x)$ where  $I_o$ is the intensity of light after P1. I cannot use this formula directly in this case because of the definition. But, if i understand correctly(which is not likely) P1 simply makes the unpolarised light plane polarised. So suppose now we consider a beam of unpolarised light. This can be thought of as a mixture of many plane polarised lights.consider any one of them and apply malus law. Now $I_o$ is the original intensity and x is the angle of the pass axis w.r.t the chosen plane polarised light. Since this can be chosen absolutely randomly, angle x can vary randomly from 0 to 2pi. We can theorefore find the EXPECTED transmitted intensity to be the average of $cos^2(x)$ as x varies from 0 to 2pi, which returns 1/2.
Is this a correct proof of the question? I am not satisfied myself. Any help with regard to my proof woulf be appreciated. Also, i would like a physical explanation if possible.</p>

<p>HI franklinsing, Thanks for the questions:</p>

<p>Hello! I'm franklinsing and I was planning on working on the Diffraction Applet. I have a few questions-</p>

<p>Is the simulation supposed to include only single slit diffraction or both single slit and multiple slit (diffraction grating)?</p>

<p>Ans: only multiple slits (say 10, for concreteness). And I wouldn’t worry about the single-slit envelope, since the grating slit width is usually small enough that the light diffracts into the forward half-plane.</p>

<p>Should it model only a single wavelength of light or should you be able to model any number of wavelengths, including white light?</p>

<p>Ans: Just one wavelength. It will be for light, but you don’t need to constrain yourself to that. In particular, the applet I was looking at was <a href=""http://falstad.com/ripple/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://falstad.com/ripple/</a> Setup: plane wave 1 plane source, 1 frequency Edit walls, and then put in a periodic grating (at least on my computer there’s a location indicator is the lower left — the slits must be equally spaced and of equal size). Note: Changing the resolution erases any modifications. 2nd note: if you can figure out what the coding for the import file is (just put some walls in and look at the export text), you could do the whole thing by numbers, and it would be very easy to modify to find the best setting. (I have no idea what the second part of the answer means)</p>

<p>Are there any very specific controls that you would like to see, that are not commonly available in most applets?</p>

<p>Ans: For this I’d be happy with a video (i.e., no controls). Though if there was to be any controls, then controlling the wavelength (to show how different colors diffract in different directions) would be good.</p>

"277764","Peierls Substitution - no effect for sunlight?","<p>I started to play with the Peierls substitution in a tight binding model. A good derivation can be found in <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/178003/tight-binding-model-in-a-magnetic-field"">this question here on PhySX</a>.</p>

<p>The hopping matrix elements change according to $t\rightarrow e^{\frac{i}{q}\int_R^{R'} \mathbf{A} \,\text{d}l }$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is the electromagnetic vector potential.</p>

<p>I made the following assumptions on the em field, which interacts with my model: Let the electric field be of the form
$$\vec{E}(x,t) = E_0 \cos(kx-\omega t) \vec{e}_y,$$
so that with $\vec{E}(x,t) = - \partial/\partial t \; \vec{A}(x,t)$
$$\vec{A}(x,t) = \frac{E_0}{\omega} \sin(kx-\omega t)\vec{e}_y.$$</p>

<p>If I now use that the power is approximately given by $P=1300$ W/M$^2$, I get that
$$E_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2P}{\epsilon_0 c}} \approx 700 \;\text{V/M}.$$
If I further assume that the integral in the exponent of the hopping term can be approximated by
$$\int_R^{R'} \mathbf{A} \,\text{d}l \approx \frac{1}{2}(R'-R)[A(R',t)-A(R,t)]\approx \frac{1}{2} a [A(R+a,t)-A(R,t)]]\leq a\cdot \frac{E_0}{\omega},$$</p>

<p>I end up with a value for the exponent which is of the order of magnitude of $10^{-8}$, so that this has almost no effect! The factor $a$ denotes the lattice constant, which is usually of the order of $10^{-10}$ meter, and $\omega$ would be something around $10^{15}/s$.</p>

<p>Did I go wrong somewhere and made false assumptions? I find it hard to believe that sunlight should not have any effect on the material in question (or the model, which describes the material).</p>

<p>Are there better ways to describe the interaction with sunlight in the context of tight-binding models (or more precisely: Hubbard Hamiltonians)? </p>

<ol>
<li>Whether or not observable quantities must be gauge-independent?</li>
<li>If the observable quantities are gauge-dependent. What is the meaning of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first question, I find some quantities are gauge dependent and these quantities are measured by experiments; for example, the charge densities on the different sublattice of graphene. The symmetry of pseudo-spin is not a good symmetries of Lagrangian, which leads to the fact that there is not a gauge-covariant fields to couple with pseudo-spin. As a results, the 0-components of pseudo-spin currents are gauge dependent and these quantity can be measured by STM. Thus, the question is to explain the physical significance of gauge-dependent terms.</p>

<p>Now recently I heard online that there is a thing called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"" rel=""nofollow"">Hawkings radiation</a> - in that black holes create particles and these are then destroyed and what little does get away from the event horizon give it an appearance of a glow/halo effect.</p>

<p>Assuming this to be correct, I then questioned what would happen if a blackhole (which I understand to be relatively stationary to everything around it (we are all moving away from supposed big bang? therefor we are all relatively not moving very fast but comparatively to a theoretical 100% stationary object moving insanely quick)) were to exhaust its ""food"" supply within range of its gravitational pull.</p>

<p>Ie: Starve. no more input and even a tiny output would cause it to loose mass.</p>

So in that sense a particle cannot have a definite momentum energy or momentum. That I understand. I just want to confirm what happens during measurement of say momentum or energy. </p>

<p>So we measure some definite value of momentum or energy which is an eigenvalue of the momentum or Hamiltonian (since the operators commute for a free particle). Then we would in principle collapse the wave function to some stationary state $\Psi_k$ but in this case we know that this is not possible (physically realizable). So do we measure a particular value of the momentum with some measurement uncertainty, with the uncertainty giving us the spread of values of the observable or do we measure a particular momentum and infer that there is a spread from above? Or do we not measure a particular value ever but rather a range of values for a given measurement?   </p>

"277825","Can the constancy of the speed of light be explained by the constancy of the power of light?","<p>Here's what I mean:-</p>

<p>If we consider a journey between two fairly arbitrary points, let's say they are both somewhere out in space between Earth and the Sun.
Now assume I carry out the same journey twice at different constant speeds. </p>

<p>Based on intuition, I would expect the average power I received from the sunlight in each case to be the same. That would make sense, because if I had a solar panel mounted on my vehicle I would not expect it to generate more or less power from the light just because I was travelling fast. (A bit of definite integration of energy over time should prove this.)</p>

<p>So I've deduced (albeit intuitively) that the power I get from the sunlight during the same journey is independent of my speed of travel. </p>

<p>But the power of the sunlight is also directly proportional to the speed of light - I'm basing this on the assumption that if the speed of light was zero, the sun would generate no power, and if the speed of light was twice what it is then the sun would generate twice the power. I may be wrong.</p>

<p>So putting the two parts together, according to my intuitive energy based view on things, if the power of light is independent of my velocity relative to its source as it seems to be, then the speed of light must also be independent of my velocity relative to its source.</p>

<p>My conclusion is</p>

<p>The speed of light must be the same to an observer in any inertial reference frame because the power density [JS<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-3</sup>] due to a light source at any given distance from the light source is the same for an observer in any inertial reference frame.</p>

<p>I can't see a mistake in my calculations.  Can anyone see where I am going wrong here?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Here is what I did to get that answer:</p>

<p>$$\begin{gather}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} = \frac{-2x}{A}\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} \\ \implies \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} = \left[\frac{-2}{A}+\frac{4x^2}{A^2}\right]\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} = \frac{-2}{A}\left[1-\frac{2x^2}{A}\right]\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} \\ \implies \hat p\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} = \frac{2\hbar^2}{A}\left[1-\frac{2x^2}{A}\right]\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} \\ \implies \frac{e^{-x^2/A^*}}{B^*}\hat p\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} = \frac{e^{-x^2/A^*}}{B^*}\frac{2\hbar^2}{A}\left[1-\frac{2x^2}{A}\right]\frac{e^{-x^2/A}}{B} = \frac{2\hbar^2}{A|B|^2}\left[1-\frac{2x^2}{A}\right]e^{-x^2(\frac 1A+\frac 1{A^*})}\end{gather}$$</p>

<p>Then I use Mathematica to compute $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx\ \left[1-\frac{2x^2}{A}\right]e^{-x^2\operatorname{Re}(A)/|A|^2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}|A|(A-\operatorname{Re}(A))}{\operatorname{Re}(A)^{3/2}}$$</p>

"277849","Pauli Exclusion Principle with Gravitational Potential Energy?","<p>In course notes such as this one (www.physics.drexel.edu/~bob/Term_Reports/John_Timlin.pdf) that explain the Pauli pressure in white dwarfs and neutron stars, there is usually a chain of logic as follows:</p>

<p>Step 1. Treat the particles in a particular astrophysical body as particles bounded by an impenetrable spherical box. So the energy states are described by three quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, $n_z$ such that:
$$ E_n \propto n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 $$</p>

<p>Step 2: Calculate the maximum energy that can be packed into a spherical box of volume $V$. Effectively, we get a function: $ E = f(V,O) $ where $O$ stands for other variables.</p>

<p>Step 3: Calculate the Pauli Pressure by differentiating $E$ with respect to $V$:
$$ P_{Pauli} = - \frac{\partial E}{\partial V} = - \frac{\partial f(V,O)}{\partial V} $$</p>

<p>Step 4: Calculate the gravitational pressure and equate it with the Pauli pressure to obtain a relationship between various parameters of the astrophysical body. </p>

<p>My question is: why do we treat the gravitational pressure separately? Why not just include gravitational potential energy in the Hamiltonian? In other words, instead of using
$ H = P^2/2m + V_{box} $ and getting energy eigenstates $E_n \propto n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2$, why don't we use the Hamiltonian:
$$ H = P^2/2m + V_{box} + V_{gravitational} $$ And then calculate the corresponding eigenstates? </p>

I know that I should solve for the integral, but when I did, the answer was incorrect. Is there something that I am missing?</p>

<p>Here is the problem:</p>

<p>After a ball rolls off the edge of a horizontal table at time $t = 0$, its velocity as a function of time is given by:
$$\vec{v} = 1.0 \hat{i} − 9.8t \hat{j}$$
where $v$ is in meters per second and $t$ is in seconds. The ball's displacement away from the edge of the table, during the time interval of $0.320\mathrm{s}$ for which the ball is in flight, is given by:
$\vec{Δr}$ = the integral from $0.320$ to $0$ of $v dt$.</p>

<p>To perform the integral, you can use the calculus theorem
The integral of $[A + B f(x)] dx$ = the integral of $A dx + B$ times the integral $f(x) dx$.</p>

<p>I'm good so far, but this is where it confuses me!  I can write this as:
$v(t) = v(t_0) + at - at_0$ and if I integrate this with respect to time again to get the displacement I end up with:</p>

<p>$$\int_{t_0}^{t} v(t)\ \mathrm{d}t = \int_{t_0}^{t} [v(t_0) + at - at_0]\ \mathrm{d}t = v(t_0)t\biggr|_{t_0}^{t} + \frac{1}{2}at^2\biggr|_{t_0}^{t} - at_0 t\biggr|_{t_0}^{t}$$

$$x(t) - x(t_0) = v(t_0)(t - t_0) + \frac{1}{2}at^2 - \frac{1}{2}at_0^2- at_0t + at_0^2$$

$$x(t) = x(t_0) + v(t_0)(t - t_0) + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2 - t_0^2) - at_0t$$
All of this matches up the usual equation
$$x(t) = x_0 + v_0(t - t_0) + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2 - t_0^2)$$

"277873","Is bias in a probabilistic experiment a coincidence?","<p>I probed the data from a recently published entanglement experiment for the purpose of checking whether the pairs remain independent of previously measured pairs.</p>

<p>So, I gathered the imbalance (bias) between outcomes over time. </p>

<p>For example, if you look at difference between total number of heads and total number of tails at any time, in a coin toss experiment of say 280000 tosses.</p>

<p>Suppose the total number of tails remains higher than total number of heads for most of your experiment but eventually they become equal. The difference first increases to a peak and then decreases to make the outcome 50/50. The experiment is concluded at that point, instead of continuing to see how the bias behaves afterward.</p>

<p>Now, suppose you do this experiment with 4 coins at the same time, in parallel and same trend is seen with all 4 coins. i.e. Number of tails takes a lead, the lead keeps accumulating and peaks and then starts to clear and outcome become 50/50 in the end, at the same time, for all 4 coins.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the peak bias is not very high - between 1% to 2.34%. Which can look like a probabilistic distribution.</p>

<p>But the question is about magnitude, plus same direction of bias in all 4 coins and clearing of the bias at the same time in all 4 coins.</p>

<p>The question is - Is the observation (link below), of any significance, or it can be just a rare coincidence?</p>

<p>What explains the same direction/trend that was observed in all 4 setups. 1) Same direction/trend of bias, 2) concurrent clearance of bias in all setups.</p>

<p>The reason for probing experimental data this way, is that Bells inequality is often used to prove or disprove certain theories related to quantum entanglement.</p>

<p>If the data itself can be found not independent over time, then Bell's inequality would not be applicable to such data.</p>

The first is the usual Fock space formulation in infinite Minkowski space, the second uses a finite volume; in my example I shall use a cubic volume with side length $L$. </p>

<p>The way I currently understand it, the second formulation is used in order to avoid having to deal with operator-valued tempered distributions as would arise in the infinite volume case.

<p>I would also like to use this question to make sure I understand the mathematical details in both cases correctly. $c=\hbar=1$. I don't want to worry too much about the quantization procedure and just talk about the resulting quantum theory.</p>

<p>This paragraph explains notation. I denote 3-vectors by bold letters and four-vectors by cursive letters. If $\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ then $\mathbb{R}^4\ni k:= (\omega_k, k_1, k_2, k_3)$, where $\omega_k=\omega_\mathbf{k}:=\|\mathbf{k}\|$ is the dispersion relation in vacuum with $c=1$. On the other hand, if $\mathbb{R}^4\ni x=(t,x_1,x_2,x_3)$ then $\mathbf{x}:=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. The euclidian scalar product of 3-vectors is denoted $\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y}$ and the Minkowski Product of four vectors is denoted $x\cdot y:= x_0 y_0 - \mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{y}$. I am following the book ""Finite Quantum Electrodynamics - The causal approach"" 3rd edition by G. Scharf, pp. 146-156.</p>

\end{equation}</p>

<p>This is a time dependent, operator-valued tempered distribution (?), where the Hilbert space is something like the symmetric Fock-space over the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$, but I'm not sure how the set of four different creation operators is supposed to act on this space. Hence <strong>Question 1: What is the exact Hilbert space?</strong> </p>

<p>The mutually adjoint operator valued distributions $\mathsf{a}^{\mu}(\mathbf{k}),\mathsf{a}^{\mu}(\mathbf{k})$ satisfy
\begin{equation}
[\mathsf{a}^{\mu}(\mathbf{k}), \mathsf{a}^{\nu}(\mathbf{k'})]=\delta_{\mu\nu}\delta(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}'), 
\end{equation}
Consider test functions $f,g\in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^3,\mathbb{C})$ in the Schwarz space of rapidly decaying functions.  (Scharf only considers real-valued test functions. I don't understand why.) Then the action of such a distribution is in the sense of</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mathsf{a}^{\mu}(f):= \int_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^3} f(\mathbf{x})\mathsf{a}^{\mu}(\mathbf{x}),
\end{equation}
where <strong>Question 2: What is the action of the above operator on a general element of the Hilbert space?</strong> (where one would have to know what the Hilbert space is)</p>

<p>Scharf continues to compute the commutator
\begin{equation}
[\mathsf{A}^{\mu}(x), \mathsf{A}^{\nu}(y)]=\delta^\mu_\nu\frac{1}{i}D_0(x-y),
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where $D_0$ is the Lorentz invariant Jordan-Pauli function for mass zero. He observes that the equation is not Lorentz-covariant and redefines the zero-component of $\mathsf{A}^{\mu}$ to be a skew-adjoint operator instead of self-adjoint, which makes the commutation relation lorentz-covariant. He observes that all expectation values of the redefined $\mathsf{A}^0$ will vanish for states in the ""physical subspace"" of the Fock-space in question (which is defined as the precise subspace where that is the case). <strong>Question 3: I find this a bit suspect. Are there more elegant approaches to this problem? Or further ways of justifying the procedure?</strong> (I like the approach where one abandons positive-definiteness of the scalar product even less though.)
He derives the free Hamiltonian</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mathsf{H}=\int_{\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^3} \omega(\mathbf{k})\sum_{\mu=0}^3 \mathsf{a}^{\mu}(\mathbf{k})^\dagger\mathsf{a}^{\mu}(\mathbf{k})
\end{equation}
and claims that the energy is positive definite. (This means, the spectrum of $\mathsf{H}$ is non-negative, right?) <strong>Question 4: Does this define a unitary time evolution?</strong> (assuming for a moment one were to use the Schroedinger picture, which one of course will not.) Scharf does not impose any gauge conditions up until this point. The discussion of Gauge and space-time symmetries does not interest me here.</p>

<p>===========================================================</p>

<p><strong>My main question is to relate the above to the following approach which uses a finite volume of space</strong>: This approach is mainly following  (R.J. Glauber, Coherent and incoherent states of radiation field, Phys. Rev. 131 (1963) 2766-2788)
Say $V$ is the standard cube in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with volume $L^3$. (I'm not exactly sure of the mathematical details; it's probably supposed to be the open cube.)</p>

<p>Consider a set of functions $\mathbf{u}_k: V\mapsto \mathbb{C}^3$ (where $k$ is a set of discrete parameters) satisfying
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot {\mathbf{f}_k}=0\\
\nabla^2 \mathbf{f}_k+\frac{\omega_k^2}{c^2}\mathbf{f}_k=0\\
\int_V \overline{\mathbf{f}_k(\mathbf{r})}\cdot\mathbf{f}_l(\mathbf{r})d \mathbf{r}=\delta_{kl}\\
\text{The } \mathbf{u}_k \text{ are complete.}
\end{align}
That is, an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space $L^2(V,\mathbb{C}^3)$. An example for such a system is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}_{(\lambda, k_1, k_2, k_3)}(\mathbf{x}) = L^{-\frac{3}{2}}\mathbf{e}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}   \exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{x}),\qquad \text{where }  (\lambda\in\pm 1, k_i\in \frac{2\pi}{L}\mathbb{Z})         
\end{equation}
Where the real unit vectors $\mathbf{e}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}$ are chosen orthogonal to each other (for each $\mathbf{k}$ and different ""polarizations"" $\lambda$) and to their respective $\mathbf{k}$. I guess these are basically the expansion functions/vectors for Fourier series in 3 dimensions. I will denote them as $\mathbf{u}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}$ and write a sum $\sum_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}$ where $\lambda$ and the components of $\mathbf{k}$ run over the discrete values specified above.</p>

<p>This second approach, as I have seen it, fixes the gauge before quantization. I'm not sure if that is necessary, probably not. In any case the Radiation Gauge is chosen, that is to say the Coulomb gauge $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A}=0$ together with the condtition that the scalar potential vanishes, which can be satisfied only for the free field in the absence of charges (which is what both formulation deal with).
One then defines the 3-component operator</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\vec{\mathsf{\mathsf{A}}}(t, \mathbf{x})&amp;=\sum_{\lambda=1}^2\sum_{\mathbf{k}} \frac{\mathbf{e}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}}{L^ {3/2}\sqrt{2\omega_{\mathbf{k}}}} \left(\mathsf{a}_{\lambda \mathbf{k}} e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}} t)} + \mathsf{a}^\dagger_{\lambda \mathbf{k}} e^{-i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}} t)}  \right)\\
&amp;=\sum_{\lambda\mathbf{k}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_{\mathbf{k}}}} \left( \mathsf{a}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{u}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{x})e^{-i\omega_{\mathbf{k}}t} +  \mathsf{a}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} \overline{\mathbf{u}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}}(\mathbf{x}) e^{i\omega_{\mathbf{k}}t}\right)
\end{align}
together with the hamiltonian operator
\begin{equation}
\mathsf{H}= \sum_{\lambda\mathbf{k}} \omega_{\mathbf{k}} (\mathsf{a}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}}^\dagger \mathsf{a}_{\lambda\mathbf{k}} +\frac{1}{2} ).
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Once again I'm not entirelly sure what the Hilbert space is. It is clear that one can separate the Hilbert space into sectors with fixed wave vector as one could separate the Hilbert space into sectors with fixed photon number in the first case. <strong>I want to know what the relationship is between the two Hilbert spaces for both formulations of the theory, as well as what kind of limit procedure could be used to relate results from one to the other</strong>. Glauber writes the state of the entire field as
\begin{equation}
| \{ \alpha_k \} \rangle= \prod_k | \alpha_k\rangle_k
\end{equation}
where a state $|\alpha\rangle$ may be seen as a certain state for the standard quantum harmonic oscillator on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. While it is intuitively clear that the description specifies an oszillator state for each wave vector and polarization, as the system is seen as a system of infinitely many non-interacting harmonic oszillators for each mode of the field, I'm not entirelly sure what the mathematical meaning of the formula is. <strong>Would the appropriate Hilbert space for the entire field be the tensor product of the single-mode Hilbert spaces?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks a lot to anyone who read through all of the above and can give me as much a hint towards the solution of any of the questions. I'm very grateful in advance for any suggestions or references.</p>

<p>With this I know that $\int_A pdA$ and I know that $dA=W\Delta z$ and the equation of a circle is $z^2+(\frac{W}{2})^2=R^2$ and solving for W I get $W=2\sqrt{R^2-Z^2}$ so now the integral is $\int (p)2\sqrt{R^2-Z^2}\Delta z$ ; $p=\rho g z$ so in turn I get $\int_0^R 2\rho g z \sqrt{R^2-Z^2}\Delta z$ or $\int_0^R 2\rho g z \sqrt{R^2-Z^2}dz$</p>

"277902","Need some help with tensors","<p>I am in a General relativity course and I am pretty new to tensors.  My professor says that he will leave learning about how to manipulate tensors up to our reading (as there is a section in the book describing it, namely the book by Carroll) but I am still confused about a few things.  Here is a problem I just solved but I want like to have more detail as to what is going on.</p>

<p>The problem says,""For a group of particles all moving with the same velocity, $\tilde{\beta} = \beta \tilde{e}_x$ as seen in an inertial reference frame S with a rest-mass density of $\rho_0$, calculate the stress-energy tensor.""</p>

<p>So again, I have the solution and I was able to obtain it, but I don't understand it.  So for a perfect fluid, the stress energy tensor only has one component, namely,
\begin{equation}
T^{\mu \nu} = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\rho_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>The 4-velocity of an intertial frame moving with velocity $\tilde{\beta}$ is given by:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
U^{\mu} = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\gamma \\
\gamma \beta \\
0 \\
0  
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>So in the solution it says, ""By transforming to a frame moving in the x-direction with velocity $-\beta$, we find the nonzero components.""</p>

<p>So to obtain  the solution they provide, I have determined, purely by mathematical manipulation that I need to do the following (I do not think my notation is correct):</p>

<p>First write:
\begin{equation}
U^{\mu}U^{\nu}=
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\gamma^2 &amp; \gamma^2\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\gamma^2\beta &amp; \gamma^2\beta^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Then I did this this:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
T^{\mu\nu}\otimes U^{\mu}U^{\mu}=
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\gamma^2\rho_0 &amp; \gamma^2\rho_0\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\gamma^2\rho_0\beta &amp; \gamma^2\rho_0\beta^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
which is the answer.  But why does this represent a transformation to the moving frame?  Also, I think there may also be something with the sign of $\beta$ as it is moving $-\beta$ with respect to the particles rest frame.  Also, I am not sure my use of $\otimes$ is correct.  All I did was matrix multiply $U^{\mu}U^{\nu}$ with $T^{\mu\nu}$.  Any help would be appreciated! </p>

"277917","Derivation of fluid velocities in a cylindrical annulus","<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A cross-section of the cylinder shown below is hollow along the annulus. The annulus volume is occupied partially by gas and partially by liquid as shown in the figure. The dimensions of the solid, gas, and liquid are also marked in the figure in terms of their radius. I derived the solution for flux (flow rate, $m^3/s$) of gas ($q_g$) and liquid ($q_l$), which are shown under the derivation section. </p>

<p>The steps involved in obtaining this solution are shown under the section of derivation. I started with Navier-Stokes equation for steady-state flow of both fluids to derive velocity, which is shown in terms of its integrated form with constants $C_i$ ($i=1,2,3,4$). Remaining part of the derivation shown below are self explanatory.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0hmI0.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0hmI0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Issue:</strong> If there is only liquid in the annulus, i.e., $r_2=r_1$, then let's call that flux as $q_{l,only}$. Now, if we compare the flux of liquid in the presence of gas ($q_l$) and the flux of liquid without gas ($q_{l,only}$), then the following condition must hold true.
$$q_l\leq q_{l,only}$$</p>

<p>However, as I decrease $r_2$ to increase $q_l$, the above condition gets violated below a certain threshold value of $r_2$ that varies if $r_1$ is varied. <strong>My question is to know why the above condition is getting violated</strong>. Please note that the similar condition also holds for gas, and that condition for gas is satisfied perfectly well.

"277938","Using delta functions to relate particles to phase space (Newtonian)","<p>I have a question about equilibrium solutions for the phase space (usually introduced in the context of Vlasov equation but that's not needed here) and its relation to particles in a simple Newtonian $V\propto 1/r$ potential (one body problem). I need this in order to normalize density in my simulation code.</p>

<p>I have been trying to relate discrete functions to some given phase space at $r_0$ but run into problems in relating sums to integrals.</p>

<p>Assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>$&lt;f(t,r_0,\mathbf{v})&gt;_t=f_0(r_0,\mathbf{v})$, where $&lt;f&gt;_t$ is some known <strong>continuous</strong> phase space density in equilibrium (averaged over time t)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now assume a delta function solution:</p>

<p>$f(t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})=\omega_0 \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_i}(t))\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v_i}(t))$</p>

<p>Which can be understood as follows: We have some N particles going on a trajectory following the path $\mathbf{x_i}$ with velocity $\mathbf{v_i}$ at time $t$. </p>

<p>I want to make this equivalent to the assumption, and solve: </p>

<p>$\omega_0$</p>

<p>The way I try to tackle this is by taking the time average of $f$ (the notation will become easier to read in the next equation):</p>

<p>$&lt;f(t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})&gt;_t=\omega_0 \frac{1}{N T} \sum_{i=1}^N\int_0^T dt \delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_i}(t))\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v_i}(t))$</p>

<p>And to solve $\omega_0$, I say: </p>

<p>$&lt;f(t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})&gt;_t d^3x d^3v=f_0(\mathbf{x_0},\mathbf{v}) d^3x d^3v$</p>

<p>However, this does not seem to have a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Rest of the derivation</strong></p>

<p>Now there's an obvious problem when saying that the distribution is continuous: </p>

<p>If we integrate over a region of $d^3x d^3p$ and say that the time particle $i$ spends in the region $d^3x d^3p$ is $dT_i$, we get:</p>

<p>$&lt;f(t,\mathbf{x_0},\mathbf{v})&gt;_t=\omega_0 \frac{1}{NT}\sum d T_i=f_0(\mathbf{x_0},\mathbf{v})d^3x d^3p$</p>

<p>If we further assume spherical symmetry:</p>

<ul>
<li>$d^3x = 4 \pi r^2 dr$</li>
<li>For each particle $T=T_i$ = orbit time</li>
<li>$\frac{2ds_i}{v_i}=dT_i\implies dT=\frac{dr}{v_r}=\frac{dr}{v \cos \hat\theta}$ (time spent in the volume is proportional to distance travelled per orbit)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above simplifies to:</p>

<p>$&lt;f(t,\mathbf{x_0},\mathbf{v})&gt;_t$</p>

<p>$=\omega_0 \frac{1}{NT}\sum d T_i$</p>

<p>$\rightarrow\omega_0 \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{dT_i}{T_i}=f_0(\mathbf{x_0},\mathbf{v}) (4 \pi r_0^2 dr) d^3p$</p>

<p>$\implies\omega_0 \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{dr_i}{T_i \cdot v_i \cos \hat \theta_i}=f_0(r_0,\mathbf{v}) (4 \pi r_0^2 dr) d^3p$</p>

<p>$\implies\omega_0 dr \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{1}{T_i \cdot v_i \cos \hat \theta_i}=f_0(r_0,\mathbf{v}) (4 \pi r_0^2 dr) d^3p$</p>

<p>Cancelling $dr$:</p>

<p>$\implies\omega_0 \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{1}{T_i \cdot v_i \cos \hat \theta_i}=f_0(r_0,\mathbf{v}) (4 \pi r^2) d^3p$</p>

<p>Taking $N\rightarrow \infty$:</p>

<p>$\implies\omega_0 (\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{T_i \cdot v_i \cos \hat \theta_i})=f_0(r_0,\mathbf{v}) (4 \pi r^2) d^3p$</p>

<p>After this, I have no idea what to do in order to get $\omega_0$; the left hand side is a sum and the right hand side is an integral. Not to mention that when $\theta_i$ goes to $\pi/2$, the sum doesn't converge.</p>

"277939","Can a television detector van REALLY tell if you have the TV switched on?","<p>In the UK, it was regularly  advertised by the BBC, and the Post Office, that they had vans that could check if your TV was on, even if you were in an apartment block full of other people's TVS. </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kG00j.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kG00j.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>TV ""Detector Van"", <strong>Well, well before my time, let me make that very clear</strong>.</p>

<p>Apart from now being able to pay my TV licence :), what really prompted this question  were these quotes from:</p>

<p>Television Detector Vans</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Britain's ad-free BBC, renowned for the quality of its news and television broadcasting, is funded by an annual fee on television use. But it's also famous for its sinister TV Detector Vans, which legend has it can tell if unlicensed televisions are in operation behind closed doors.</p>
  
  <p>The beeb's (BBC for non brits) secret sauce will remain secret, however, as Britain's Information Commissioner has swatted down a Freedom of Information request for information on the size of the BBC's van fleet and the technology used. (As of 2016)</p>
  
  <p>The BBC explained that the number of detector vans in operation, the location of their deployment and the frequency is not common knowledge. It relies on the public perception that the vans could be used at any time to catch evaders. This perception has built up since the first van was launched in 1952 and has been a key cost effective method in deterring people from evading their licence fee. The BBC state that to release information which relates to the number of detection devices and how often they are used will change the public’s perception of their effectiveness. If the deterrent effect is lost, the BBC believes that a significant number of people would decide not to pay their licence fee.</p>

<p>So my question is, was my Post Office and State TV lying to me? Can a television detector van REALLY tell if you have the TV switched on</p>

"277940","Randomness in quantum phenomena","<p>I'm reading ""Six Quantum Pieces"" as a introduction to quantum mechanics.
Assuming that we have two functions. One that determine the probability for a photon to be transmitted, and other the probability for it to be reflected:
$$

P_{r} = sin^{2}(\alpha)
$$
Based on the preposition that the behaviour of a photon is unpredictable when beamed into a polarizer... Isn't $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ or } \alpha = 0$ a counter example for that?</p>

<p>Sorry if it's a stupid question... But, at the moment, I can't agree with that sentence, because when $\alpha = 0$ I can assume that it's direction of oscillation is going to be the same as the polarizer, and $cos^{2}(0) = 1$ so the probability will be 100%!!!</p>

"277951","Question about centripetal acceleration when marble slides down sphere","<p>I ran across a conceptual problem while solving this situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A marble is sliding down from the top of a larger sphere, at what angle from the vertical will it leave the sphere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I solved the problem by using the fact that the marble will leave the sphere when the radial component of the gravitational force is equal to the centripetal force the marble is experiencing. My problem is this: why is there centripetal acceleration at all?</p>

<p>I understand that the marble is moving in a circular path while on the sphere, but why doesn't all of the gravitational force in the radial direction go into the normal force?  I know this would mean that the only force acting on the marble would be a tangential force so it's not correct, but why?</p>

<p>I guess my problem with it is that if we were to pick up the marble and place it an inch further on the sphere, there wouldn't be a centripetal force, all of the radial force would be normal; so when does it become centripetal and why? Also, isn't circular velocity increasing as the ball falls, so wouldn't that change the centripetal acceleration?</p>

<p>Sorry if this question is a bit trivial, but I'm just confused. Thank you in advance for your help. </p>

"277967","Spherical harmonics (Schrodinger equation in spherical coordinates)","<p>The normalized angular wave functions are called spherical harmonics:$$Y^m_l(\theta,\phi)=\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)}{4\pi}\frac{(l-|m|)!}{(l+|m|)!}}e^{im\phi}*P^m_l(cos\theta)$$
How do I obtain this from <a href=""http://www.physics.udel.edu/~msafrono/424-2011/Lecture%2017.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> (Page 8)?</p>

<p>The normalisation condition for $Y$ is $$\int^{2\pi}_0\int^{\pi}_0|Y|^2\sin\theta d\theta d\phi=1$$ Note that $0\le \phi \le 2\pi $ and $0\le \theta \le \pi $. </p>

<p><strong>For $\theta$ it has to be between 0 and $\theta$  because $\int^{sin2\pi}_{sin\pi}$ will cancel out $\int^{sin\pi}_{sin0}$ right? If that is true, don't we need to times 2 for $\int^{sin\pi}_{sin0}$ or mod $\int^{sin\pi}_{sin0}$ into $|\int^{sin\pi}_{sin0}|$?</strong>  </p>

<p>The $Y$ above comprise of both the $\Theta(\theta)$ and $\Phi(\phi)$.
$$\Theta(\theta)=A*P^m_l(cos\theta)$$ where $A$ is the coefficient, $x$ is $\cos\theta$, $P$ is the associated Legendre Polynomial.
$$\Phi(\phi)=e^{im\phi}$$
$$Y^m_l(\theta,\phi)=A*e^{im\phi}P^m_l(cos\theta)$$ where $A=\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)}{4\pi}\frac{(l-|m|)!}{(l+|m|)!}}$.
<strong>I know how to obtain $\Phi$ but not A from $\Theta$, which is why I don't know how to obtain the spherical harmonics equation above.</strong></p>

<p>One more question why do we need to obtain the spherical harmonics equation? Why can't we just leave it like how the author did it for the radial equation (without combining the solutions of radial equation and its normalization condition) in Page 9? We can do that for the angular equation too by leaving it separated from its normalization condition.</p>

"277996","Are electrons directed stationary energies in string theory?","<p>In classic theory of electromagnetic radiation light is propagated in spherical waves. In his paper on the photoelectric effect Einstein argued that radiation of light consists of a finite number of directed energy quanta called photons.</p>

<p>I got this idea:</p>

<p>The electric field from an electron does not extends in a spherical way, but is a directed stationary energy and identical with the electron itself. The electrical field around a charged body is then the sum of directed 1-dimensional electrons that extends from the body.</p>

<p>I have red that one reason for the development of string theory was to avoid the extrem uncertainty related to a point-particle, which in quantum theory is interpreted as ""probability clouds"" and my question is: </p>

"278008","AM semiclassical Thermal conductivity","<p>In studying the semiclassical theory of transoprt applied to the thermal conductivity, as treated over the Ashcroft &amp; Mermin textbook (pg 254), one finds that the current densities for a given band (band index is suppressed) can take the form 
$$ \mathbf{j}=\mathbf{L^{11}\mathcal{\vec{E}}}+\mathbf{L^{22}(-\nabla}T) $$
$$ \mathbf{j^q}=\mathbf{L^{21}\mathcal{\vec{E}}}+\mathbf{L^{22}(-\nabla}T)$$

$$ \mathcal{\vec{E}} = \mathbf{E}+\frac{\nabla\mu}{e}$$</p>

<p>and $\mathbf{E}$, $\nabla\mu$ and $\nabla T$ are weak, spatially uniform, time independent electric field, temperature gradient and chemical potential gradient. The $\mathbf{L^{ij}}$ are matrices based on this integral</p>

<p>$$ \mathbf{\mathcal{{L}^{\alpha}}}=e^2\int\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}\Big{(}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathcal{E}}\Big{)}\tau(\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{k}))\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{k})\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{k})(\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{k})-\mu)^\alpha $$</p>

<p>where the integral is over a k-space primitive cell, $\mathbf{v v}$ is a dyadic product between the velocities of the electrons in the band, $\tau$ is the energy-dependent relaxation time and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathcal{E}}$ is the energy derivative of the fermi function. Now, and HERE IS MY PROBLEM, the book says that this integral can take the form </p>

<p>In the following reaction for radioactive dating:</p>

<p>$$C^{14}_6 \longrightarrow N^{14}_7 + e_{-1}^0  + \overline{\nu_e}$$</p>

<p>The neutral carbon-14 atom initially had $6e^-$, $6p$ and $8n$ in which a neutron decayed into a proton and an electron leaving a nitrogen atom with $7p$, $6e^-$and $7n$ and the high energy electron from the neutron decay escaped from the atom :</p>

<p>$$n^1_0\longrightarrow p^{1}_1 + e_{-1}^0  + \overline{\nu_e}$$</p>

<p>$\hskip2in$
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Beta-minus_Decay.svg"" alt=""Bound neutron decay""><pre>
<img src=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"" alt=""Fig 1: Bound neutron decay"" title=""tooltip""></pre>
Now it is evident that the nitrogen atom has a positive charge and in totality, it is a positively charged gas (which could be a matter of great concern since a lot of charge at one place could ionize the surroundings and could even lead to the dielectric breakdown of the atmosphere, provided there is a lot of charge.)</p>

<p>The above predicted results are not normally observed partly because it has a half life of about 5700 years (corresponding to extremely low concentrations) and that the nitrogen atom ""might"" take an electron from the surroundings, or the electron might just not escape from the gas... (This is unclear.)</p>

<p>Moreover, in the following reaction : (with a half life of about $11s$)</p>

<p>$$Mg^{23}_{12}(g) \longrightarrow {Na^{23}_{11}}^-(g) + e^{0}_{+1} + \nu$$</p>

<p>The magnesium-23 has $12p$, $12e^-$ and $11n$ to start with and after the $\beta^+$ decay, sodium-23 atom with $12n$, $11p$ and $12e^-$ is left behind, which is a negatively charged ion. The $\beta^+$ radiation proceeds according to the reaction:</p>

<p>$$p^1_1\longrightarrow n^{1}_0 + e_{+1}^0  + \nu_e$$   </p>

<p>With a high concentration of Mg-23 atoms we could(or should) achieve a negatively charged sodium gas in less time. Now the same doubt arises that whether the ions will remain so, or if lose an electron to the surrounding (which would still not solve the problem), or capture the positron (which is also unlikely due to the high speed).</p>

<p>Now, to neutralize the charge on the atom, it should lose/gain an $e^-$. Here comes the k capture reaction in which an electron and a proton combine to form a neutron according to the following reaction:     </p>

<p>$$p^1_1+ e_{-1}^0\longrightarrow n^{1}_0   + \nu_e$$   </p>

<p>Accordingly when an electron is ""captured"" by a charged species to neutralize the charge, that electron orbits the nucleus rather than go through all the orbitals and collide with the nucleus (which is made clear by the following observed reactions). </p>

<p>$${Na^{22}_{11}}^+(g) + e_{-1}^0 \longrightarrow Na^{22}_{11}(g)$$</p>

<p>where the positively charges sodium atom takes an electron (which revovles around the nucleus) to neutralize its net charge and the reaction isn't known to follow as:</p>

<p>$${Na^{22}_{11}}^+(g) + e_{-1}^0 \longrightarrow Na^{22}_{10}(g)$$</p>

<p>wherein we assume it to be a k capture reaction and algebraically add the subscripts and the superscripts. Since it isn't a nuclear reaction, the electron wouldn't really go through towards the nucleus.</p>

<p>This way I don't really see why an $e^-$ should ever come on the left hand side in a nuclear reaction (while it does in the k capture reaction).</p>

<p>But the k-capture or electron capture is found to occur in nature, so how can an electron really collide with the nucleus? Even if the innermost electron is allowed to be ""sucked in"" by the nuclear force, the angular momentum would still be conserved and the electron would move with faster and faster tangential velocities and much lower radial velocity (relativistic effects might have to be considered). This way, wouldn't it take infinite time for it to happen, with the radial speeds becoming infinitesimal (by also considering the quantum model, where the electrons in the 1s orbital have a random/unknown path but it can be said that they don't move just radially since they have to join the dots of their appearance)?</p>

<p>Also, when the electron and a proton are really close to each other, the binding energy is really high, and the point when the electron and the proton ""collide"", the whole system would have a really low potential energy (alost approaching  $-\infty$ eV, since in the preceding case, the potential energy was decreasing, but it won't be Infinity due to the finite size if the electrons and protons). Wouldn't it result in the emission of huge amount of energy (after obviously subtracting the kinetic energy)?</p>

<p>P.S: It is slightly(rather wildly) off topic, but since we are considering the case when the electron is moving at speeds near $c$ while coming towards the nucleus (due to increase in the tangential velocity), do we take the increased mass into the consideration of the mass of the atom altogether, or is it frame dependent (even galaxies move at speeds beyond $c$ with respect to us)? </p>

"278014","Newtonian mechanics - where does the energy come from?","<p>I am imagining an object on the floor. If I pick up the object moving it upwards with a constant velocity then a net force must be applied to that object in order to have it go from not being in a state of rest to being in motion. It has accelerated and F(net)=ma. It now has kinetic energy equal to 1/2mv^2. As the object moves upwards (at constant velocity) it gains gravitational potential energy (GPE). I am under the impression that the work done on that object is equal to the GPE that it gains as it moves upwards.</p>

<p>So if the work done has gone into storing the GPE and they are equal, where did the energy come from which made it accelerate and gain kinetic energy in the first place? It seems as though the energy put into lifting it must be equal to the acceleration caused and thus the kinetic energy gained AND the GPE too. I am also under the impression that the kinetic energy and GPE are equal. So it seems as though I have done work on the object and the work done is equal to the sum of K.E and GPE. How is that possible? Surely that way I have gotten out twice the energy that I put in which is clearly nonsense. </p>

<p>Also, if the K.E and GPE are equal, how is it that it can keep moving upwards with a constant velocity and hence a constant K.E and the GPE is increasing?</p>

<p>The more I write and the more I go over this in my head, the more confused I get and the more frustrated I get which just makes it more difficult. Not to mention the headaches! </p>

<p>Again, sorry if this is really stupid and i'm fairly certain that what I have asked here will make little sense but it's the best that I can do with the mess in my head. Even just writing this I have thought of many other apparent problems and contradictions which I can't even begin to formulate into a coherent question.</p>

<p>$$ \psi(x) = e^{ - \frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{2\sigma_{x}^{2}}} $$</p>

<p>Again, which is not properly normalized, so we can just ignore the constant up front.</p>

<p>Okay, so now, for my question, my understanding is for it to look like a Gaussian in k-space, we have to demand that there is an underlying relation between the width in x-space to k-space. And that relation is therefore,</p>

$$e^{-it[\omega\sigma_{z} + \omega_{0}a^{*}a + V\sigma_{z}\otimes(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a)]}\left(\rho_{S}\otimes\rho_{\beta}\right)e^{it[\omega\sigma_{z} + \omega_{0}a^{*}a + V\sigma_{z}\otimes(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a)]} = \\ e^{-it[\omega +\omega_{0}a^{*}a + V(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a)]}\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert e^{it[-\omega +\omega_{0}a^{*}a - V(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a)]} $$
Now, I understand the basic premise here, that this lets us remove some matrix terms from our exponential, but here arises my first question: I understand that this is a legal move because of $\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert + \lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert = \mathbb{I}$, but I was told there are three other cases I need to consider to have a complete picture of the dynamics.  It seems pretty clear, to me, that one of these cases is going to be $e^{-it[\dots]}\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert e^{it[\dots]}$.  But I'm not certain about the other two: $$e^{-it[\dots]}\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert e^{it[\dots]}?$$ $$e^{-it[\dots]}\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert e^{it[\dots]}?$$  $$e^{-it[\dots]}\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert e^{it[\dots]}?$$  $$e^{-it[\dots]}\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert e^{it[\dots]}?$$ <strong>How does one know which are the four cases needed?</strong></p>

<p>Proceeding with the example calculation, the terms were rearranged in the following manner: $$e^{-it[\omega +\omega_{0}a^{*}a + V(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a)]}\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow\rvert(\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{\beta})\lvert\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert e^{it[-\omega +\omega_{0}a^{*}a - V(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a)]} = \\ e^{-2i\omega t}\langle\uparrow\rvert\rho_{S}(0)\rvert\downarrow\rangle\lvert\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow\rvert\otimes e^{-it[\omega_{0}a^{*}a + V(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a])}\rho_{\beta}e^{it[\omega_{0}a^{*}a + V(ga^{*} + \bar{g}a])}$$

"278055","Computing relative velocities from angular velocity","<p>Consider two people on a disk of radius R, distances $r_1$ > $r_2$ from the center. 
Suppose the disk rotates at angular velocity $\vec{\omega}$. The velocities of the two people relative to the ground are $\vec{\omega}$ x $\vec{r_1}$ and  $\vec{\omega}$ x $\vec{r_2}$ respectively. If you then calculated the velocity of person 2 from the frame of reference of person 1, you would get $\vec{\omega}$ x $\vec{r_2}$ - $\vec{\omega}$ x $\vec{r_1} \ne 0$. But, if two people are on a carousel they should measure each other's velocity as 0.  </p>

However, if the accelerating voltage keeps being increased, the current increases until the mercury atoms get excited again, and so on, with voltage peaks getting higher and higher each time. I understand that the current increases due to the fact that the electrons are accelerated more as the voltage is increased, so they get to the anode faster. However, I feel that doesn't still change the number of electrons that get to the anode per unit of time (current), so how come can the current be increased? The only way I see this could happen would be if the cathode released more electrons per minute.</p>

"278064","Beating the physics of a railgun","<p>Ive recently been thinking of rail guns.  When i first learned about this type of motor ( we use to call it the linear motor), i read that the projectile would eventually reach a top speed because of faraday's law creating a counter current. 
However, what if the magnetic field ( the one that is required for lorentz force to work) was created by an electromagnet that was wired in series with the actual rails. It seems that the ""faraday induced voltage"" could never get strong enough to cancel out the voltage of the battery powering the rails. I say this because the ""faraday induced voltage"" relies on the magnetic flux and should the voltages cancel out, the magnetic field would be cancelled also. Since no mag field, their would no longer be any mag flux and the ""faraday induced voltage would be zero"" allowing the projectile to accelerate. </p>

<p>Ive tried to model the scenario with an equation of speed vs distance travelled of the projectile but i keep hitting a wall as the ""faraday induced voltage"" depends on the speed which depends on the current which depends on the ""faraday induced voltage"". Having the magnetic field also depend on the faraday induced voltage and complicates it even further. </p>

<p>Im sure I've gone wrong with my reasoning somewhere but regardless Has any one tried to model this scenario or even model the speed vs distance graph of a railgun with constant mag field?? </p>

I am particularly interested in decay diagrams. Dr. Rajiv Desai's blog seems to be something I will explore further. I am a novice, and appreciate the response and reference/diagrams I received from the Count. The following is from a section in Dr. Desai's blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evidence of the Higgs boson decaying to fermions!
  On 4 July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN announced the discovery of a new particle, which was later confirmed to be a Higgs boson. The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, which helps answer how some elementary particles acquire mass, was postulated almost 50 years ago, but its existence was only directly confirmed by this discovery. For their proposal, with others, of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, the Nobel Prize in Physics 2013 is awarded to François Englert and Peter Higgs.  For physicists, the discovery meant the beginning of a quest to find out what the new particle was, if it fit in the Standard Model, our current model of Nature in particle physics, or if its properties could point to new physics beyond that model. An important property of the Higgs boson that ATLAS physicists are trying to measure is how it decays. The Higgs boson lives only for a short time and disintegrates into other particles. The various possibilities of the final states are called decay modes.  So far, ATLAS had found three different decay modes that provided evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson. The decay modes are: a Higgs boson decaying into two photons, into two Z bosons and into two W bosons. These three modes have something very fundamental in common: they all involve elementary bosons! The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism was first proposed to describe how gauge bosons acquire mass. The Standard Model, however, predicts that fermions also acquire mass in this manner, meaning the Higgs boson could decay directly to bosons or fermions. Other theoretical models forbid the decay to fermions, or allow it, but not necessarily at the same rate as the Standard Model. The new preliminary result from ATLAS shows clear evidence that the Higgs boson indeed does decay to fermions, consistent with the rate predicted by the Standard Model. The new results show that the Higgs boson decays into subatomic particles that carry matter called fermions — in particular, it decays into a heavier brother particle of the electron called a tau lepton. This decay has been predicted by the Standard Model. </p>

<p>The idea being that the slab is hinged on one side. There is a small rod which is attached to the slab also on a hinge. There is a linear force pushing the unhinged side of the rod towards the hinged base of the slab. The slab is intended to raise. The gray image shows the position of the slab and lever after it's been raised some. Obviously with the setup shown in the image it will not raise past a certain point, but it's a good basis for the calculations I need.</p>

<p>It seems obvious that the force will change as the slab raises (more force the lower/more horizontal the slab is). All I really need is the max force. (anything less is obviously covered). All the weights, angles and measurements will be known. I'm not looking for the answer, but rather for the math/formulas so I can figure out where exactly to place the lift rods, the length of the rods, etc. I don't want to start buying parts only to find the necessary force will be way too high to do it like this.

"278126","Gravity manipulation i s it a possibly?","<pre><code>I have done almost no research on the subject of ""anti-gravity"" (I hope it won't show too much) but I contemplate it among other kind of out there things often.  I'm reaching out to you as it looks like someone may have poked around at many of the fringes of research like this. To the point, before I lose you assuming I have you at this point.  I look at gravity as an inverse of centrifugal force and I think that is how it can be solved. I will start simple and work my way to less simple.  Imagine that amusement park ride that was like a big bowl and all the riders just leaned up against the wall..  It begins to spin picking up speed until all the riders are pinned up against the wall.  Ok hold that thought but put it aside for the moment.  Now envision that ride modified with another bowl inside of that bowl. Or a hamster wheel inside of another hamster wheel.  The inner wheel or bowl only connected to that outer bowl or wheel with beams,seals,an electric motor, sealed hollow chambered bearings and with inner chambers filled with a conductive liquid metal.  The liquid metal is only taking the place of wiring to transfer power delivered to the outer wheel and transferred to the motors that will turn the inner wheel.  So now we have the large outside wheel that can turn and a smaller inside wheel only supported by that outside wheel.  We have power to both.  Now we stand this contraption up on end more like a Ferris wheel than the original wheel we set aside earlier.  Of course we have to have anchors to the ground and supporting beams anchoring that outer wheel but we can use wires to get power to the electric motors turning that wheel.  The electric motors supported by the outer wheel are for the inside wheel that will have power transferred by the liquid metal taking the place of wires as I mentioned earlier. Wires can not twist and turn but the conductive liquid will have no problems with the motion.  I could probably take twenty pages describing this and blueprints describing it exactly but hope this email will be enough for your imagination.
</code></pre>

<p>For others safety sake and maybe a bit of humor I will now be the only rider.  I will go to the inside wheel and strap myself in.  You will turn the power on the wheels.  The outside wheel will go one direction fast enough that if I was strapped into that wheel I would have been held against its side.  Power is also going to the inside wheel but going the opposite direction controlled with that remote rheostat I forgot to mention, with a speed holding me against the floor of that wheel also..  The speeds will be identical adjusting for diameter differences in the wheels.  You will tweak the speed of the inner wheel until I am directly looking down toward the ground.  I will now undo my restraint and stand up.  As you look at me I am upside down and in relation to you standing still and upside down as you are standing firmly on the ground watching. I'm pretty sure I could walk a bit in that inner wheel, jump forward, backward or up and down. You could zero my artificial new floor where ever you wanted just by adjusting the rheostat and then matching the two wheel speeds again.
   I call this two D gravity manipulation. Now imagine three D or Four or even five. Also imagine adding extreme electromagnetic forces to all the wheels maybe emough so that the extreme energy would supercede the effect of mass induced gravity forces.  Energy is mass but just in a diluted form after all. What would happen then? Could we unleash the outer wheel from the ground and would something magical happen ussuming controlls were also added by angleing some ring or combination of rings?   Or..... would we just have to keep that outer wheel firmly connected to the ground and stay content with a neat magician's trick?
I am loaded with ideas like this.  Give me a shout back if anyone thinks there is any merit here.  My main concern in this brain storm is that the counteracting centrifigal forces would cancel each other out and nothing would happen.   For some unscientific reason I don't believe that to be the case.  I think I could build a miniature versin for just hundreds of dollars.  Large enough to support a man or women I suspect the costs would get a bit pricey.</p>
